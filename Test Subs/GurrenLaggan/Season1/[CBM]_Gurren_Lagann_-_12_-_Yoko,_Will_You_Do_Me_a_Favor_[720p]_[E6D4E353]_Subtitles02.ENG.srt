00:00:10,670 --> 00:00:15,510
Gurren Lagann

2
00:00:15,580 --> 00:00:18,110
<font color=#FFFF00>Kimi ha kikoeru?
</font>Can you hear it?

3
00:00:18,250 --> 00:00:26,250
<font color=#FFFF00>Boku no kono koe ga yami ni munashiku suikomareta
</font>This voice of mine was sucked emptily into darkness

4
00:00:26,600 --> 00:00:31,700
<font color=#FFFF00>Moshimo sekai ga imi wo motsu no nara
</font>If the world has meaning to it,

5
00:00:32,030 --> 00:00:36,570
<font color=#FFFF00>Konna kimochi mo muda de ha nai
</font>Then these kinds of feelings aren't futile

6
00:00:36,910 --> 00:00:42,610
<font color=#FFFF00>Akogare ni oshitsubusarete akirametetanda
</font>I was crushed by my longing and had given up

7
00:00:42,910 --> 00:00:47,870
<font color=#FFFF00>Hateshinai sora no iro mo shiranaide
</font>Without even knowing the color of the endless sky

8
00:00:48,280 --> 00:00:53,190
<font color=#FFFF00>Hashiridashita omoi ga ima demo
</font>I began to run, because my feelings, even now,

9
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:58,960
<font color=#FFFF00>Kono mune wo tashika ni tataiteru kara
</font>Are definitely beating against my heart

10
00:00:59,230 --> 00:01:04,030
<font color=#FFFF00>Kyou no boku ga sono saki ni tsudzuku
</font>The me of today will continue towards our destination

11
00:01:04,500 --> 00:01:10,060
<font color=#FFFF00>Bokura nari no asu wo kizuite yuku
</font>We'll amass our own tomorrows

12
00:01:10,410 --> 00:01:18,900
<font color=#FFFF00>Kotae ha sou itsumo koko ni aru
</font>The answer, yes, is always right here

13
00:01:33,210 --> 00:01:37,720
This is the tale of a man who continues
to fight against fate.

14
00:01:38,890 --> 00:01:42,300
Simon learns the sad secret
behind Nia's birth.

15
00:01:42,890 --> 00:01:45,720
Confronted with the devious trap
set by Guame of the Four Generals,

16
00:01:45,850 --> 00:01:49,100
...the Core Drill on Simon's chest
gives off a blinding light,

17
00:01:49,270 --> 00:01:51,650
...and Gurren Lagann
stands reborn.

18
00:01:52,110 --> 00:01:55,030
The man has gotten back
on his feet.

19
00:01:59,860 --> 00:02:03,830
So, even the great Guame, the Immovable,
with his long, distinguished service,

20
00:02:03,950 --> 00:02:07,040
...was given the runaround
by these humans. Pathetic.

21
00:02:08,460 --> 00:02:11,960
I don't have to take that from someone
who never leaves the comfort of the Capital.

22
00:02:12,090 --> 00:02:17,210
The Spiral King has but to give the word,
and his servant, Cytomander, will go forth.

23
00:02:18,130 --> 00:02:19,720
And Adiane?

24
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:22,220
She has yet to return.

25
00:02:22,300 --> 00:02:24,640
That woman doesn't know
when to give up.

26
00:02:25,310 --> 00:02:27,020
And Dai-Gunzan?

27
00:02:27,310 --> 00:02:30,520
Proceeding on a direct course
here to Teppelin.

28
00:02:33,650 --> 00:02:36,360
Luck seems to have turned
in Adiane's favor.

29
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:38,440
What do you mean?

30
00:02:38,570 --> 00:02:40,990
They're heading right for the sea.

31
00:02:41,320 --> 00:02:47,080
<font color=#000000>Episode 12:
Yoko, Will You Do Me a Favor?</font>

32
00:02:50,040 --> 00:02:54,500
It's a big water puddle!

33
00:02:55,040 --> 00:02:59,630
Are you guys stupid?
This here is called "the sea!"

34
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:00,800
The sea?

35
00:03:00,880 --> 00:03:04,470
It's a place where water from rain and rivers
and stuff gathers from around the world.

36
00:03:05,470 --> 00:03:06,850
I'm amazed you know all that.

37
00:03:06,970 --> 00:03:10,770
I've heard stories about it before,
but this is my first time seeing it.

38
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:14,020
The sea, huh?

39
00:03:14,310 --> 00:03:17,820
Listen up!
Water in the sea is salty!

40
00:03:17,900 --> 00:03:20,070
Salty sea water,
salty pee water!

41
00:03:20,150 --> 00:03:22,950
- Yeah, so what?
- It's just something to go around.

42
00:03:23,070 --> 00:03:24,950
- Go around!
- Around! Go around!

43
00:03:30,330 --> 00:03:31,960
What's with those ridiculous outfits?

44
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:35,420
If you've come to the sea,
you've got to go swimming!

45
00:03:35,540 --> 00:03:38,550
In addition to swimming, we can
also confirm if the water is salty.

46
00:03:38,670 --> 00:03:41,420
Yeah! Get into your swimsuits
and let's all go swimming!

47
00:03:41,930 --> 00:03:44,430
- All go swimming...
- In our swimsuits...

48
00:03:44,590 --> 00:03:47,050
And that means--

49
00:03:49,140 --> 00:03:51,060
You clowns!

50
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:55,480
What are you thinking, you perverts?

51
00:03:55,610 --> 00:03:58,520
Making our way to the Capital is our
top priority right now, remember?

52
00:03:58,610 --> 00:04:00,280
We don't have time to goof off!

53
00:04:00,360 --> 00:04:02,990
That's not entirely true.

54
00:04:03,320 --> 00:04:07,450
Take a look. This is Teppelin Palace
at the heart of the Capital.

55
00:04:07,700 --> 00:04:13,830
Oh, I see. To get to Teppelin, we have
no choice but to cross this sea.

56
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:17,830
Right. But Dai-Gurren is land-based,
so it can't go into the water.

57
00:04:17,920 --> 00:04:19,290
Then how do we do it?

58
00:04:19,590 --> 00:04:21,460
I thought this might happen!

59
00:04:22,090 --> 00:04:25,010
So for just such an occasion,
I whipped up a set of aquatic gear!

60
00:04:25,130 --> 00:04:28,300
It won't be ready for
a while yet, though.

61
00:04:28,470 --> 00:04:29,600
That means--!

62
00:04:29,720 --> 00:04:32,640
That you have plenty
of time to goof off.

63
00:04:32,770 --> 00:04:35,060
Awesome!

64
00:04:36,100 --> 00:04:37,770
Awesome!

65
00:04:37,980 --> 00:04:39,940
Yahoo!

66
00:04:42,190 --> 00:04:44,570
C'mon, guys!
Let's suit up, too!

67
00:04:48,070 --> 00:04:49,200
You're not going?

68
00:04:49,280 --> 00:04:51,700
Swimming around
under the sun, huh?

69
00:04:52,290 --> 00:04:54,710
I guess that might be fun.

70
00:05:01,090 --> 00:05:02,420
Salty!

71
00:05:02,550 --> 00:05:04,460
Yes, very salty.

72
00:05:04,550 --> 00:05:08,390
When tears stream down women's faces,
this is where they end up!

73
00:05:10,970 --> 00:05:12,470
Here they come!

74
00:05:20,060 --> 00:05:22,900
What the hell? What's with that thing
wrapped around her waist?

75
00:05:22,980 --> 00:05:27,900
Yeah, what's up with that?
She's showing LESS skin than usual!

76
00:05:27,990 --> 00:05:31,780
Take away the skin, and what's she
got left? Just a big-ass rifle.

77
00:05:31,990 --> 00:05:37,000
I know all that! Besides, don't you think it's
better to leave a little to the imagination?

78
00:05:37,080 --> 00:05:41,500
Are you stupid?! Everybody knows
the more skin you show, the better!

79
00:05:41,590 --> 00:05:44,090
Screw you! I'll fill you
full of lead!

80
00:05:44,170 --> 00:05:45,840
Excuse me...

81
00:05:52,930 --> 00:05:57,770
I've never worn an outfit like this before.
Do you think this is all right?

82
00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:03,320
Truly, it is better to
conceal than reveal.

83
00:06:11,820 --> 00:06:13,580
- Jealous?
- Hardly!

84
00:06:13,660 --> 00:06:15,370
When you're at the beach...

85
00:06:16,450 --> 00:06:18,330
...it's time for beach volleyball!

86
00:06:18,410 --> 00:06:20,580
Beach volleyball?
What's that?

87
00:06:20,670 --> 00:06:24,960
It's a game where you smash this ball as
hard as you can into your opponents' area.

88
00:06:25,760 --> 00:06:27,460
As hard as I can?

89
00:06:27,880 --> 00:06:32,430
Perfect! When it comes to physical
contests, I'm obviously the--

90
00:06:40,350 --> 00:06:43,060
Did I do that right?

91
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:45,570
Nia, that was awesome!

92
00:06:45,650 --> 00:06:49,530
I was given basic instruction
in sports at the palace.

93
00:06:49,900 --> 00:06:53,370
It was considered part of a
well-rounded lady's education.

94
00:06:55,330 --> 00:06:57,200
S-She's a lot more formidable
than she looks...

95
00:06:57,330 --> 00:07:00,790
C'mon, everybody! Let's do the
watermelon splitting game next!

96
00:07:10,840 --> 00:07:14,510
Why, you! Why, you!
Why, you! Why, you!

97
00:07:24,060 --> 00:07:25,860
Goodness, I did it!

98
00:07:25,980 --> 00:07:28,610
Nia, you're awesome!

99
00:07:31,820 --> 00:07:34,110
All right, everyone!
Your attention, please!

100
00:07:34,200 --> 00:07:37,870
I will now explain how my
aquatic equipment works.

101
00:07:37,950 --> 00:07:39,790
First of all...

102
00:07:53,430 --> 00:07:55,010
Good work.

103
00:07:55,470 --> 00:07:59,470
She's completely blended in.
She's a sweet girl, don't you think?

104
00:08:00,060 --> 00:08:02,680
Yeah, I can see that...

105
00:08:02,810 --> 00:08:04,850
You're mad that she's stolen
the boys away from you?

106
00:08:04,980 --> 00:08:07,690
- No, of course not.
- I'll bet.

107
00:08:10,530 --> 00:08:13,320
After you swim, you gotta
have a barbecue!

108
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:15,570
Here!

109
00:08:17,990 --> 00:08:20,620
Go on, Yoko!
Eat up!

110
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:23,120
S-Sure.

111
00:08:30,340 --> 00:08:32,170
Yoko dropped her crab!

112
00:08:32,260 --> 00:08:34,510
Nia slaved away to make that!

113
00:08:40,430 --> 00:08:42,770
Gotcha!
Just kidding!

114
00:08:43,940 --> 00:08:46,440
I'll make you another, Yoko.

115
00:08:46,900 --> 00:08:49,900
I'm sorry.
I don't want any!

116
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:51,610
Yoko?

117
00:08:51,690 --> 00:08:55,280
- What's HER problem?
- She can't take a joke!

118
00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:56,700
Yeah, it joke!

119
00:08:56,780 --> 00:08:59,620
- Learn to read the room, lady!
- Yeah, read room!

120
00:09:00,200 --> 00:09:04,580
It's (more or less) all done!

121
00:09:05,080 --> 00:09:07,170
Will this really work?

122
00:09:07,250 --> 00:09:09,040
It's all good!
(More or less...)

123
00:09:10,170 --> 00:09:11,500
So, what's different?

124
00:09:11,590 --> 00:09:13,760
The bridge doesn't look
any different.

125
00:09:13,840 --> 00:09:16,050
All that's left is a few last
fine adjustments.

126
00:09:16,180 --> 00:09:19,470
- Hey, that's my--
- Launch!

127
00:09:34,400 --> 00:09:38,660
Dumbass! Give us
a little warning first!

128
00:09:47,870 --> 00:09:49,710
- Well?
- Incredible!

129
00:09:49,830 --> 00:09:52,040
- In that case, make it official!
- Right!

130
00:09:52,840 --> 00:09:54,960
Set course for Teppelin!

131
00:09:55,050 --> 00:09:57,420
Aye aye!

132
00:10:21,320 --> 00:10:24,240
That one looks funny!
It's weird!

133
00:10:25,040 --> 00:10:26,620
Gimmy, what's that?

134
00:10:26,750 --> 00:10:31,000
Oh, wow! Bubbles are coming
out of their butts!

135
00:10:33,590 --> 00:10:36,920
Ship detected on the underwater radar!
Closing in at high speed!

136
00:10:37,210 --> 00:10:40,430
It's almost directly beneath us...
This reading is a Gunmen!

137
00:10:40,510 --> 00:10:42,180
Hard right rudder!

138
00:10:42,260 --> 00:10:43,720
Too late!

139
00:10:50,270 --> 00:10:51,230
What was that?!

140
00:10:51,270 --> 00:10:53,980
<b>Submarine Fortress Gunmen:
Dai-Gunkai</b>

141
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:56,980
Torpedo Gunmen 1, 2, and 3,
direct hits!

142
00:10:57,070 --> 00:10:59,940
I guess this is what they mean
by moths flying to the flame.

143
00:11:00,280 --> 00:11:01,030
Right.

144
00:11:01,110 --> 00:11:03,490
I'll go out in Sayrune.

145
00:11:03,570 --> 00:11:06,200
You take command
of Dai-Gunkai.

146
00:11:06,290 --> 00:11:07,330
Yes, ma'am!

147
00:11:07,450 --> 00:11:12,210
All right, you stinking humans! I'm gonna
make you regret that you shamed me!

148
00:11:12,670 --> 00:11:14,920
I'll send you straight
to the bottom!

149
00:11:16,500 --> 00:11:20,010
<font color=#FFC9B9>Gurren Lagann</font>

150
00:11:21,510 --> 00:11:25,010
<font color=#FFC9B9>Gurren Lagann</font>

151
00:11:25,180 --> 00:11:26,890
Open fire!

152
00:11:31,020 --> 00:11:33,690
Yeah! Direct hits on all shots!

153
00:11:33,770 --> 00:11:35,690
No, no hits at all.

154
00:11:35,820 --> 00:11:37,110
Enemy ship descending!

155
00:11:37,190 --> 00:11:38,940
Switch over to depth charges!

156
00:11:39,070 --> 00:11:41,070
- Coming right up!
- You got it!

157
00:11:56,750 --> 00:11:58,750
Detonations above
the port bow!

158
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:03,300
Lousy humans... That's pathetic.
You'll have to try harder than that!

159
00:12:03,590 --> 00:12:06,010
Tubes 1 through 6, fire!

160
00:12:18,860 --> 00:12:20,820
I'm going out!
Cover me!

161
00:12:20,940 --> 00:12:22,530
Hey, wait a minute!

162
00:12:30,160 --> 00:12:31,870
What's going on?!

163
00:12:33,580 --> 00:12:36,370
The Gunmen haven't been
waterproofed yet!

164
00:12:36,460 --> 00:12:38,000
You should've said
something earlier!

165
00:12:38,090 --> 00:12:40,000
Torpedo Gunmen to
the left of the ship!

166
00:12:42,970 --> 00:12:44,420
It's no use!
It's too fast!

167
00:12:44,720 --> 00:12:46,890
It's way faster than
those torpedoes earlier!

168
00:12:47,050 --> 00:12:49,550
It's on a direct course!
Take immediate evasive action!

169
00:12:59,320 --> 00:13:01,270
Major damage to No. 3 Bridge!

170
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:07,570
Gimmy and Darry are safe!

171
00:13:07,660 --> 00:13:09,200
Hurry, close emergency bulkheads!

172
00:13:09,950 --> 00:13:13,160
The torpedo Gunmen is coming around
again for another pass! It's fast!

173
00:13:13,540 --> 00:13:17,620
From its shape, it's not a torpedo...
It's a Four Generals custom Gunmen!

174
00:13:18,130 --> 00:13:19,830
If this keeps up, we're history!

175
00:13:19,920 --> 00:13:23,050
I guess our only option is to
take a chance with our Special.

176
00:13:24,050 --> 00:13:28,380
Gurren Lagann's special regenerative ability
should make it watertight, too!

177
00:13:28,970 --> 00:13:30,680
Underwater combat
should be possible, too!

178
00:13:30,810 --> 00:13:34,560
- We haven't exactly confirmed that...
- We'll find out soon enough in the water!

179
00:13:34,810 --> 00:13:38,390
We're counting on you boys!

180
00:13:44,070 --> 00:13:45,900
- How are we?
- Leakage points, zero!

181
00:13:46,450 --> 00:13:48,860
We're good to go!
I knew it could--

182
00:13:52,160 --> 00:13:54,740
Is this it?!
You bastard!

183
00:13:56,960 --> 00:14:00,210
Stinking human, challenging me
to battle in the water...

184
00:14:00,290 --> 00:14:03,090
...was the last mistake
you'll ever make!

185
00:14:06,970 --> 00:14:08,970
General Adiane has
the upper hand!

186
00:14:09,220 --> 00:14:11,550
We are now making
for Dai-Gunzan.

187
00:14:12,390 --> 00:14:17,230
Gurren Lagann, I had hoped
to dispatch you personally.

188
00:14:17,310 --> 00:14:20,400
But I will offer you
to General Adiane!

189
00:14:20,730 --> 00:14:23,310
Vent all of my anger
on them, ma'am!

190
00:14:23,860 --> 00:14:29,030
Dai-Gunkai!
Arm Cutters!

191
00:14:29,490 --> 00:14:31,990
Foot flippers destroyed!
Propulsion is down!

192
00:14:33,740 --> 00:14:35,120
They've grabbed us!

193
00:14:35,330 --> 00:14:37,080
What? What are they up to?

194
00:14:37,330 --> 00:14:41,540
Down trim full!
Dive, full power!

195
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:47,010
We're being pulled under!

196
00:14:51,220 --> 00:14:53,090
Simon!
Dai-Gurren's in trouble!

197
00:14:53,180 --> 00:14:54,470
Guys!

198
00:14:54,970 --> 00:14:56,220
Crap!

199
00:14:56,600 --> 00:14:59,730
Oh, so you think you can afford to divide
your attention while facing me, do you?

200
00:14:59,810 --> 00:15:01,310
Don't insult me!

201
00:15:03,650 --> 00:15:06,360
It's no use!
She's moving too quickly!

202
00:15:09,740 --> 00:15:10,900
We're taking on water!

203
00:15:11,200 --> 00:15:13,360
So much for
the tough guy act.

204
00:15:13,780 --> 00:15:15,830
- We're gonna drown!
- We're taking on water!

205
00:15:15,950 --> 00:15:17,330
What do we do?!
What do we do?!

206
00:15:17,790 --> 00:15:19,450
Everyone.

207
00:15:19,960 --> 00:15:21,790
Please remain calm.

208
00:15:21,870 --> 00:15:23,250
Nia?

209
00:15:24,210 --> 00:15:28,210
Everything will be all right. I know that
Simon will come up with something.

210
00:15:28,300 --> 00:15:30,090
How do you know that?

211
00:15:30,930 --> 00:15:32,590
Just because, no real reason.

212
00:15:33,010 --> 00:15:35,390
Just because?

213
00:15:35,550 --> 00:15:40,480
It's not based on anything in particular.
I just know Simon will find a way.

214
00:15:40,890 --> 00:15:43,310
That's what I think.

215
00:15:49,110 --> 00:15:53,860
This is bad! Dai-Gurren is way
beyond its maximum depth!

216
00:15:54,160 --> 00:15:58,120
- It's all over! We're gonna die!
- That's cold! I can't swim!

217
00:15:58,240 --> 00:15:59,830
Please, do something!

218
00:15:59,950 --> 00:16:04,170
What will you do? You and your friends
will be crushed flat by the water pressure!

219
00:16:07,250 --> 00:16:09,380
We don't have time...

220
00:16:10,920 --> 00:16:12,510
...to fool around down here...

221
00:16:12,590 --> 00:16:13,840
What?!

222
00:16:14,130 --> 00:16:17,510
...with you and your friends!

223
00:16:26,400 --> 00:16:27,730
What the--?

224
00:16:31,530 --> 00:16:32,900
You're not getting away!

225
00:16:38,490 --> 00:16:39,620
He's fast!

226
00:16:39,740 --> 00:16:42,330
Bloody Clasper!

227
00:16:43,460 --> 00:16:46,420
Impossible! Nothing is faster
than me in the water!

228
00:16:46,670 --> 00:16:48,920
Oh, I get it!
It's drilling the water!

229
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:52,380
I guess soil isn't the only thing
your drill can move through, Simon!

230
00:16:52,970 --> 00:16:54,760
Gurren Lagann closing in fast!

231
00:16:54,840 --> 00:16:56,260
Fire, fire!

232
00:17:05,020 --> 00:17:06,310
Oo!

233
00:17:08,980 --> 00:17:12,530
Impossible!

234
00:17:34,760 --> 00:17:36,260
This isn't over yet!

235
00:17:48,350 --> 00:17:50,400
Desperate times call for
desperate measures.

236
00:17:50,940 --> 00:17:53,860
I'm going to make use of the
princess here a little longer!

237
00:17:56,570 --> 00:17:58,860
Put Nia down!

238
00:18:01,950 --> 00:18:04,580
Careful, now. I dare you
to take one step.

239
00:18:04,750 --> 00:18:06,910
I'll crush her into goo!

240
00:18:07,790 --> 00:18:10,370
- I'll shoot him.
- Wait a minute, Viral.

241
00:18:10,460 --> 00:18:14,460
I have a hostage and all, so I'll
make them kill each other.

242
00:18:14,630 --> 00:18:18,720
All right, humans! Train your
main guns on Gurren Lagann!

243
00:18:20,680 --> 00:18:24,680
Listen up. On my signal,
blow Gurren Lagann to pieces.

244
00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:28,640
Or else!

245
00:18:31,400 --> 00:18:33,020
Yoko!

246
00:18:37,360 --> 00:18:41,860
And what have we here?
That toy won't work on my Sayrune.

247
00:18:41,950 --> 00:18:45,950
Or are you going to kill the princess
and remove her as a bargaining chip?

248
00:18:47,410 --> 00:18:48,200
Yoko!

249
00:18:48,330 --> 00:18:50,540
Hey, Yoko!
Let's not be hasty here!

250
00:18:50,580 --> 00:18:51,710
Don't do it, Yoko!

251
00:18:52,080 --> 00:18:53,920
Be quiet.

252
00:19:02,760 --> 00:19:04,050
Yoko!

253
00:19:04,140 --> 00:19:07,640
Interesting...
What will you shoot next?

254
00:19:08,020 --> 00:19:10,100
An arm? A leg?

255
00:19:10,390 --> 00:19:14,060
If you make her suffer too badly,
I might start to feel sorry for her!

256
00:19:24,410 --> 00:19:26,030
What?!

257
00:19:26,580 --> 00:19:27,950
My shoulder!

258
00:19:38,800 --> 00:19:41,220
Gramps? What are you
doing here?

259
00:19:43,050 --> 00:19:47,350
Careful! Fire at that angle,
and you'll kill us both.

260
00:19:47,680 --> 00:19:50,020
Are humans that stupid?

261
00:19:50,520 --> 00:19:52,980
I hate to break it to you,
but yeah. We are.

262
00:19:53,060 --> 00:19:55,860
To hell with it!
Open fire!

263
00:20:01,860 --> 00:20:03,610
General Adiane!

264
00:20:06,030 --> 00:20:07,740
No you don't!

265
00:20:20,210 --> 00:20:24,760
Thymilph... I'm sorry.

266
00:20:42,820 --> 00:20:46,200
Let's ride this wave
straight to shore!

267
00:20:57,830 --> 00:20:59,630
She is dead?

268
00:21:04,970 --> 00:21:08,050
Damn you, Gurren Lagann!

269
00:21:08,180 --> 00:21:10,970
Damn! DAMN!

270
00:21:17,900 --> 00:21:21,190
Yoko, could you
do something for me?

271
00:21:22,030 --> 00:21:23,230
Sure, what?

272
00:21:24,860 --> 00:21:28,740
I'd like you to
tidy up my hair.

273
00:21:33,750 --> 00:21:37,080
Oops. This stuff isn't exactly
my strong suit.

274
00:21:37,170 --> 00:21:39,750
Don't come complaining
to me afterwards.

275
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:41,670
It will be fine.

276
00:21:41,800 --> 00:21:43,670
Another "just because"?

277
00:21:44,050 --> 00:21:45,550
Yes!

278
00:21:52,140 --> 00:21:55,060
Why did you close your eyes
back there?

279
00:21:55,180 --> 00:21:57,690
You are a master
with a rifle.

280
00:21:57,770 --> 00:22:01,150
It was because
I had faith in you.

281
00:22:05,690 --> 00:22:07,990
Boy, what a moron...

282
00:22:08,240 --> 00:22:11,070
No, no!
I meant myself.

283
00:22:12,280 --> 00:22:14,700
Okay, all done!

284
00:22:14,750 --> 00:22:17,120
There's something refreshing
about it!

285
00:22:17,580 --> 00:22:19,370
Yeah, I think so, too.

286
00:22:19,880 --> 00:22:21,210
What do you think?

287
00:22:21,290 --> 00:22:23,540
It's fine, I guess.

288
00:22:23,920 --> 00:22:26,300
You really think so?

289

What will it take to get a smile out of
that boy who is looking up into the sky?

303
00:24:11,190 --> 00:24:14,200
I'll cook dinner
and wait for him.

305
00:24:14,450 --> 00:24:19,540

"Eat Up, Everyone".
