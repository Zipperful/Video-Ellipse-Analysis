</font>Can you hear it?

3
00:00:18,250 --> 00:00:26,250
<font color=#FFFF00>Boku no kono koe ga yami ni munashiku suikomareta
</font>This voice of mine was sucked emptily into darkness

4
00:00:26,600 --> 00:00:31,700
<font color=#FFFF00>Moshimo sekai ga imi wo motsu no nara

5
00:00:32,030 --> 00:00:36,570
<font color=#FFFF00>Konna kimochi mo muda de ha nai
</font>Then these kinds of feelings aren't futile

6
00:00:36,910 --> 00:00:42,610
<font color=#FFFF00>Akogare ni oshitsubusarete akirametetanda
</font>I was crushed by my longing and had given up

7
00:00:42,910 --> 00:00:47,870
<font color=#FFFF00>Hateshinai sora no iro mo shiranaide
</font>Without even knowing the color of the endless sky

8
00:00:48,280 --> 00:00:53,190
<font color=#FFFF00>Hashiridashita omoi ga ima demo
</font>I began to run, because my feelings, even now,

9
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:58,960
<font color=#FFFF00>Kono mune wo tashika ni tataiteru kara
</font>Are definitely beating against my heart

10

<b>One Month Later</b>

14
00:01:35,050 --> 00:01:35,840
Bro...

15
00:01:40,760 --> 00:01:47,310
I can never be you, but I'm going off
to do what only I can do.

16
00:01:51,480 --> 00:01:55,190
The things that only
Simon the Digger can do.

17
00:01:56,360 --> 00:01:58,900
It's almost time for them
to get started.

18
00:01:59,660 --> 00:02:04,540
I'll come back to visit
once this is all over.

19
00:02:42,820 --> 00:02:44,530
Welcome back.
Did you do what you needed to do?

20
00:02:44,660 --> 00:02:46,540
Welcome back!
Simon, welcome back!

21
00:02:46,660 --> 00:02:47,740
- Yeah.
- Welcome back.

22
00:02:47,830 --> 00:02:50,040
Are you done with repairs
to Dai-Gurren's levi-sphere?

23
00:02:50,120 --> 00:02:54,380
Just about. We'll be neck and neck
with their starting time.

24
00:02:54,710 --> 00:02:59,460
Let's hurry. I have a feeling that they'll
be pulling out all the stops today.

25
00:02:59,550 --> 00:03:04,550
You're right. If we don't end this soon,
we'll come apart at the seams.

26
00:03:12,060 --> 00:03:14,650
Don't worry.
We'll win, count on it.

27
00:03:15,570 --> 00:03:16,690
You mean it?

28
00:03:16,820 --> 00:03:18,860
But look at how big
that is!

29
00:03:18,940 --> 00:03:20,360
I mean it!

30
00:03:20,450 --> 00:03:23,240
Who the hell do you
think we are?

31
00:03:23,320 --> 00:03:31,540
<b>Battle for Teppelin Day 6</b>

32
00:03:26,620 --> 00:03:31,540
It is said that the god who once created
the world in seven days...

33
00:03:31,620 --> 00:03:33,960
...created man on the sixth day.

34
00:03:34,210 --> 00:03:35,500
Sire?

35
00:03:35,590 --> 00:03:38,170
Ah, that is from one of the
ancient holy scriptures.

36
00:03:38,300 --> 00:03:43,970
This is the sixth day since that rabble
arrived here. A perfect sign, Sire.

37
00:03:44,090 --> 00:03:48,720
Amusing. In that case, I ask that
I be given that task, Sire.

38
00:03:49,060 --> 00:03:51,980
Dai-Gunten will take the lead.

39
00:03:52,060 --> 00:03:53,810
It is all yours.

40
00:03:57,150 --> 00:03:59,820
To a young pup
of 200 years,

41
00:03:59,900 --> 00:04:02,440
...I see that this is still
just an exciting game.

42
00:04:02,820 --> 00:04:06,320
I must say, they're
a tenacious bunch.

43
00:04:06,450 --> 00:04:11,620
No matter how many times we stomp
on them, they sprout again like weeds.

44
00:04:11,790 --> 00:04:14,410
That is what makes them
so terrifying.

45
00:04:14,960 --> 00:04:17,670
And this in spite of the fact that I sealed
them in the depths of the earth...

46
00:04:17,750 --> 00:04:20,800
...so they would never again
take root on the surface.

47
00:04:21,260 --> 00:04:24,300
It must be the power
of the Spiral.

48
00:04:25,640 --> 00:04:26,890
For crying out loud...

49
00:04:26,970 --> 00:04:30,850
They don't even realize that this power
will lead to their destruction.

50
00:04:31,350 --> 00:04:35,350
Ignorance... Even so, it is what
allows them to fight.

51
00:04:35,730 --> 00:04:37,350
I pity them.

It's Dai-Gunten!

00:04:49,330 --> 00:04:51,410
Damn! They're here

57
00:04:51,740 --> 00:04:53,870
- Levi-sphere status?
- Leeron! How's it coming?!

58
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:55,370
Leeron!

59
00:04:55,460 --> 00:04:57,830
We are now inside
Dai-Gunten's firing range!

What's the holdup, Leeron?!

61
00:04:59,750 --> 00:05:02,050
Okay, thanks for your patience!
Repairs are complete!

62
00:05:02,130 --> 00:05:04,840
Rapid ascent!
Take us up!

63
00:05:25,530 --> 00:05:29,570
They dodged them, eh?
Scramble bomber Gunmen squadrons!

64
00:05:35,330 --> 00:05:37,410
Dai-Gunten has launched Gunmen!

65
00:05:37,620 --> 00:05:39,920
Count, five! No, eight!
Um, twelve?

66
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,880
Um... Um...
Lots!

67
00:05:42,170 --> 00:05:45,460
No prob! With big guns,
quantity counts more than precision!

68
00:05:49,390 --> 00:05:50,930
We're not hitting 'em...

69
00:05:51,510 --> 00:05:53,430
We'll send up our Gunmen, too!

70
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:56,140
- All right, that's our cue!
- Our cue...

71
00:05:56,270 --> 00:05:57,810
You better keep up, Kittan!

72
00:05:57,890 --> 00:06:00,770
Hey, who the hell
do you think I am?

Kiyoh? What do you think
you're doing?

75
00:06:06,940 --> 00:06:07,900
I'm here, too!

00:06:08,030 --> 00:06:09,780
Kiyal? You, too?

77
00:06:10,070 --> 00:06:12,450
Come on,
you're shorthanded, right?

78
00:06:12,620 --> 00:06:15,290
You little twerp, this isn't
a training exercise!

79
00:06:15,370 --> 00:06:17,950
That's a Four Generals
jumbo battleship out there!

80
00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:19,920
There's no guarantee that any
of us will come back alive!

81
00:06:20,040 --> 00:06:24,380
- That's exactly why we're going.
- Besides, we want to avenge Kamina.

82

00:06:27,880 --> 00:06:30,970
I'll watch over Dai-Gurren,
so go out there and give 'em hell!

85
00:06:31,930 --> 00:06:36,010
All right, you got it! Let's go show 'em
what the Black Siblings are made of!

86
00:06:36,140 --> 00:06:36,930
Yeah!

87
00:06:37,390 --> 00:06:38,890

88
00:06:50,860 --> 00:06:53,370
Sorry for the delay, Gurren Lagann.

Simon, we're counting on you.

90
00:06:56,450 --> 00:06:58,370
Let's get out there, Simon!

91
00:06:58,450 --> 00:06:59,700
Right!

92
00:07:12,430 --> 00:07:14,800
Let's do it!

93
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:18,520
Well, well, the amateur's turned into
a first-rate commander!

94
00:07:18,600 --> 00:07:23,190
Listen up! We'll handle the cannon fodder!
You nail that battleship!

95

- Yeah!

97
00:07:27,150 --> 00:07:30,030
- Okay, Kiyal, time to combine!
- Okay!

98
00:07:30,530 --> 00:07:35,070
King Kittan Deluxe!

99
00:07:35,160 --> 00:07:36,700
- Let's do it!
- Yeah!

100
00:07:42,120 --> 00:07:44,290
Gunmen squadron has made contact
with enemy Gunmen!

101
00:07:44,380 --> 00:07:47,590
Good. We'll let Simon and the others
take care of the airborne units.

102
00:07:48,340 --> 00:07:49,500
How are things going?

103
00:07:49,590 --> 00:07:52,720
We managed to evade their opening gambit,
but things are just getting started.

104
00:07:52,840 --> 00:07:54,510
Enemies also detected
on the surface ahead!

00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:02,980
Dai-Gundo?

108
00:08:03,060 --> 00:08:06,230
So, they've finally sent out
both battleships against us.

109
00:08:14,910 --> 00:08:19,950
Have a good taste of my heavy
bombardment Gunmen squad.

110
00:08:25,710 --> 00:08:27,080
Take evasive action!

111
00:08:27,210 --> 00:08:30,920
Easier said than done!
It's a hail of bullets to either side!

112
00:08:36,010 --> 00:08:37,390
Crap!

113
00:08:41,140 --> 00:08:43,520
This is bad!
Dai-Gurren's taking a beating!

114
00:08:43,600 --> 00:08:45,520
Can't a few of you
head back?!

115
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:48,190
Get real!
We don't have time to--

116
00:08:52,360 --> 00:08:53,570
Simon?

117
00:08:53,610 --> 00:08:56,700
Leave these guys to me!
You go help Dai-Gurren!

118
00:08:56,950 --> 00:09:00,410
Quit screwing around! Are you trying
to grandstand or something?!

119
00:09:00,740 --> 00:09:06,330
If we lose Dai-Gurren now, we won't be
able to take on that behemoth, Teppelin!

120
00:09:06,580 --> 00:09:09,000
Then we should at least
split up the squadron!

121
00:09:09,090 --> 00:09:12,000
That won't work! If we thin out
our offensive capabilities,

122
00:09:12,090 --> 00:09:14,760
...we'd lose fights that
we could have won!

123
00:09:14,970 --> 00:09:16,090
Okay, you win.

124
00:09:16,300 --> 00:09:20,100
All right, we're all going!
Let's smash those surface Gunmen!

125
00:09:20,180 --> 00:09:21,180
Yeah!

126
00:09:21,260 --> 00:09:23,600
Simon, these guys
are all yours.

127
00:09:25,770 --> 00:09:27,350
I'll handle 'em!

128
00:09:33,860 --> 00:09:38,740
What a fool! What do you think you can
do with a single Gunmen, naked ape?

129
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:41,660
Just try me!

130
00:10:08,140 --> 00:10:10,480
That was interesting, human,
I'll give you that!

131
00:10:12,860 --> 00:10:16,690
Simon, are you all right?
You've got to pace yourself!

132
00:10:16,780 --> 00:10:20,110
Yeah, I'll take a quick break.
You handle these.

133
00:10:42,050 --> 00:10:43,720
He's willing to kill his own men?

134
00:10:43,850 --> 00:10:45,680
Rossiu! Lob it back at them!

135
00:10:45,770 --> 00:10:47,060
Right!

136
00:10:59,240 --> 00:11:01,910
Not bad, human! But we're
just getting started!

137
00:11:02,200 --> 00:11:05,160
You still have to face the mighty
Cytomander in his Shuzack!

138
00:11:08,200 --> 00:11:09,120
Damn!

139
00:11:10,460 --> 00:11:11,250
Simon!

140
00:11:11,370 --> 00:11:13,750
That's a Four Generals
custom Gunmen!

141
00:11:13,880 --> 00:11:16,130
And it looks like Gurren Lagann's
power levels are falling!

142
00:11:16,210 --> 00:11:17,250
Aretenborough!

143
00:11:17,380 --> 00:11:19,300
I've been firing and firing
for a while now!

144
00:11:24,140 --> 00:11:26,260
Move it, you jerks!
You're in the way!

145
00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:29,350
They're acting as shields
for the others...

146
00:11:29,680 --> 00:11:33,100
It was a valiant effort, naked ape.

147
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:34,230
Crap!

148
00:11:34,310 --> 00:11:37,900
It's no use! It looks like we used
too much power all at once!

149
00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:41,610
Bro...

150
00:11:45,700 --> 00:11:47,990
It's all over!

151
00:11:51,410 --> 00:11:52,370
What the hell?!

152
00:11:52,460 --> 00:11:53,830
It's fire from ship cannons!

153
00:11:53,920 --> 00:11:55,710
What happened to my
shield Gunmen?!

154
00:11:55,790 --> 00:11:58,460
Sir, the fire isn't coming
from just one ship!

155
00:11:58,550 --> 00:11:59,750
What?!

156
00:12:00,090 --> 00:12:01,380
Now!

157
00:12:02,220 --> 00:12:03,840
Where's that fire coming from?

158
00:12:03,930 --> 00:12:06,260
From the east!
On the eastern horizon, it's--

159
00:12:14,850 --> 00:12:18,150
That's... It's Bro's flag!

160
00:12:18,570 --> 00:12:21,360
Do you read me,
members of Team Gurren?

161
00:12:21,490 --> 00:12:22,530
Who are you?

162
00:12:22,610 --> 00:12:25,780
We saw those pictures that
were floating in the air!

163
00:12:39,340 --> 00:12:40,500
Back in that trap?

164
00:12:40,630 --> 00:12:44,260
I'm Bachown, and I've come running
from Dokkanai Village to the south!

165
00:12:44,470 --> 00:12:49,050
I'm Basilia from Hatesai Village!
Good to meet you!

166
00:12:49,140 --> 00:12:51,430
I'm Sawbow, and I've
come from the east!

167
00:12:51,560 --> 00:12:54,730
We've been jacking
enemy battleships, too!

168
00:12:55,690 --> 00:12:57,480
You mean you guys
are reinforcements?

169
00:12:57,610 --> 00:13:00,150
That big-ass ship up there
is the head honcho, yeah?

170
00:13:00,270 --> 00:13:03,280
All turrets, cut loose!

171
00:13:07,160 --> 00:13:09,990
Reinforcements!
Reinforcements are here!

172
00:13:10,990 --> 00:13:15,370
Listen up, people! We can't
let them have all the fun!

173
00:13:15,960 --> 00:13:19,830
We'll smash all the ground units!

174
00:13:25,300 --> 00:13:27,930
Make your shots calm,
quick, and clean!

175
00:13:28,010 --> 00:13:30,600
C'mon, is that all you got?!

176
00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:33,350
H-Humans?
They're humans?!

177
00:13:33,560 --> 00:13:36,060
When did this horde
of humans get here?!

178
00:13:36,140 --> 00:13:37,690
Direct hits to armor plating!

179
00:13:37,770 --> 00:13:41,190
No. 3 ventral levi-sphere damaged!
Output is falling!

180
00:13:41,270 --> 00:13:43,860
General Cytomander! I suggest
a temporary withdrawal!

181
00:13:48,490 --> 00:13:51,660
All right, you've had your fun...

182
00:13:51,780 --> 00:13:57,790
Now, allow me to show you
what Shuzack is made of!

183
00:14:02,130 --> 00:14:05,340
A knife...?

184
00:14:06,130 --> 00:14:08,420
Punch it!

185
00:14:26,150 --> 00:14:27,820
Dai-Gunten is falling this way!

186
00:14:28,070 --> 00:14:30,070
It's on a collision course!

187
00:14:30,280 --> 00:14:32,030
No time to evade!

188
00:14:36,040 --> 00:14:40,210
Cytomander, you were
a fool of a hatchling...

189
00:14:51,550 --> 00:14:53,090
We did it... We did it!

190
00:14:53,180 --> 00:14:55,390
We sent the two of 'em
straight to hell!

191
00:15:05,020 --> 00:15:07,780
- All that's left...
- ...is Teppelin, the Capital!

192
00:15:10,490 --> 00:15:13,200
No, not yet!
I'm still reading something!

193
00:15:27,460 --> 00:15:30,970
<font color=#FFC9B9>Gurren Lagann</font>

194
00:15:32,470 --> 00:15:35,970
<font color=#FFC9B9>Gurren Lagann</font>

195
00:15:40,390 --> 00:15:42,890
A huge explosion like that,
and there's not a scratch on it!

196
00:15:43,060 --> 00:15:44,900
That thing's hard as a rock!

197
00:15:48,860 --> 00:15:50,280
Dai-Gundo's running away!

198
00:15:50,360 --> 00:15:51,650
Victory is ours!

199
00:15:51,780 --> 00:15:53,070
It's too soon to celebrate, idiot!

200
00:15:53,160 --> 00:15:54,780
Blow it to pieces right away!

201
00:15:54,910 --> 00:15:57,530
With that armor, nothing
we throw at it will work.

202
00:15:57,790 --> 00:15:59,790
I wonder what it's doing?

203
00:16:00,410 --> 00:16:02,210
It's spinning!

204
00:16:02,920 --> 00:16:03,960
Something came out!

205
00:16:04,040 --> 00:16:06,500
Looks like it's time to tidy up.

206
00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:16,760
This is just a last act of desperation!
It proves we have 'em on the ropes!

207
00:16:16,850 --> 00:16:19,680
Continue the charge!

208
00:16:29,780 --> 00:16:32,530
Spin, spin!

209
00:16:32,610 --> 00:16:36,820
This is my and Dai-Gundo's
Carousel of Death!

210
00:16:36,950 --> 00:16:39,200
Energy influx from Teppelin
holding steady!

211
00:16:39,330 --> 00:16:43,330
- Conversion efficiency over 300%!
- Area of effect is expanding!

212
00:16:43,370 --> 00:16:44,790
Growing from 4000 to 5000!

213
00:16:45,210 --> 00:16:50,750
Keep this up and wipe all traces
of these humans from the surface!

214
00:16:51,300 --> 00:16:56,510
So, Teppelin and Dai-Gundo combined,
and are generating a powerful energy barrier...

215
00:16:56,590 --> 00:16:57,890
Huh? What?

216
00:16:57,970 --> 00:17:02,430
It means that if we don't stop Dai-Gundo's
spinning, we'll never get close to Teppelin!

217
00:17:05,020 --> 00:17:07,440
- Hold on tight!
- Sis!

218
00:17:07,600 --> 00:17:10,190
Son of a bitch!
What the hell is this?!

219
00:17:10,270 --> 00:17:14,650
Damn Beastmen!
Don't screw with us humans!

220
00:17:20,450 --> 00:17:21,660
Bachown!

221
00:17:21,790 --> 00:17:22,870
Simon!

222
00:17:22,950 --> 00:17:25,960
It's no use. We have to do something
about that whirlwind!

223
00:17:26,040 --> 00:17:28,250
We can't let Bachown's death
be for nothing!

224
00:17:28,380 --> 00:17:32,550
- We have to go!
- We'll ram it, too!

225
00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:34,380
Hey! What are you
people doing?

226
00:17:34,470 --> 00:17:36,720
Are those guys morons?!
Hurry! Stop them!

227
00:17:36,800 --> 00:17:40,180
I can't! Communications are down
because of that whirlwind!

228
00:17:40,260 --> 00:17:42,260
If we don't hurry,
they'll be wiped out!

229
00:17:56,400 --> 00:17:59,530
Please stop!

230
00:18:03,740 --> 00:18:06,160
Well met, everyone.

231
00:18:07,160 --> 00:18:10,710
I'm Nia, head cook
of Team Gurren.

232
00:18:15,170 --> 00:18:17,010
Looks like they've stopped.

233
00:18:17,840 --> 00:18:23,970
As you can see, Teppelin is surrounded by
a tornado-like barrier of light at the moment.

234
00:18:24,520 --> 00:18:31,650
If we don't do something about it, you will
blow up just like those gentlemen just did.

235
00:18:32,820 --> 00:18:34,650
Please be patient for a little while.

236
00:18:34,730 --> 00:18:36,940
What good is waiting gonna do?!

237
00:18:37,900 --> 00:18:40,490
The whirlwind will stop soon.

238
00:18:41,370 --> 00:18:43,410
Simon will stop it for us.

239
00:18:45,120 --> 00:18:47,950
I say this because
Simon's drill...

240
00:18:49,040 --> 00:18:51,330
...is the drill that will
break through the heavens!

241
00:18:58,050 --> 00:18:59,550
Brother, you moron!

242
00:19:00,380 --> 00:19:01,680
Simon?

243
00:19:01,760 --> 00:19:06,260
Now that you mention it, there's been
no sign of Gurren Lagann anywhere...

244
00:19:06,390 --> 00:19:09,390
Hey, that's right!
Where did Gurren Lagann go?

245
00:19:10,520 --> 00:19:14,810
Simon, this is a sneak attack, so we
have to get it right the first time!

246
00:19:14,860 --> 00:19:15,730
I know!

247
00:19:15,940 --> 00:19:19,190
Enemy unit closing in!
Beneath us! It's underground!

248
00:19:19,490 --> 00:19:20,900
What?

249
00:19:29,410 --> 00:19:32,830
It's not working! We're just lifting it up,
we're not penetrating the armor!

250
00:19:32,960 --> 00:19:37,550
Give it time! My and Kamina's
Gurren Lagann can do more than that!

251
00:19:38,920 --> 00:19:44,510
Please, Gurren Lagann! If you
have a mind, respond to me!

252
00:19:45,800 --> 00:19:48,350
Have Dai-Gundo reverse thrust!

253
00:19:48,430 --> 00:19:49,770
Reverse thrust, sir?

254
00:19:49,850 --> 00:19:53,020
That's right! Flatten them!

255
00:19:59,900 --> 00:20:01,650
Gurren Lagann, it's--

256
00:20:02,200 --> 00:20:03,610
Been crushed?

257
00:20:04,160 --> 00:20:08,160
My, my, what a disappointing
end to things...

258
00:20:08,370 --> 00:20:11,580
Still, I suppose I should congratulate
these humans for a valiant effort...

259
00:20:11,870 --> 00:20:14,290
Just a minute, sir!
I still hear something!

260
00:20:14,370 --> 00:20:15,290
Hear what?

261
00:20:15,380 --> 00:20:18,040
It's a rasping noise...
It's a drill!

262
00:20:19,590 --> 00:20:23,760
Thanks, pal. That impact just now
drove the tip of my drill inside!

263
00:20:27,010 --> 00:20:30,720
This is just a last act
of desperation.

264
00:20:30,810 --> 00:20:34,230
He can't possibly beat my
Dai-Gundo's spinning.

265
00:20:34,350 --> 00:20:36,350
We'll see about that!

266
00:20:49,910 --> 00:20:55,830
S-Stop! Dai-Gundo mustn't be
spun around the other way!

267
00:21:11,810 --> 00:21:13,720
Round and round...
Round and round...

268
00:21:13,810 --> 00:21:17,140
Are you watching, Lordgenome?

269
00:21:17,310 --> 00:21:21,520
Your humble servant Guame
is still spinning!

270
00:21:39,840 --> 00:21:42,550
That crazy S.O.B. Simon
actually did it!

271
00:21:42,880 --> 00:21:45,420
The whirlwind has disappeared!

272
00:21:47,090 --> 00:21:50,140
You did it, Simon...

273
00:21:50,220 --> 00:21:54,520
Okay, people! All that's left now
is to level Teppelin, so--

274
00:21:57,940 --> 00:21:59,900
Huge buildings are falling this way!

275
00:22:00,690 --> 00:22:02,360
What's going on?

276
00:22:02,440 --> 00:22:06,440
- Teppelin, it's...
- It's crumbling on its own?

277
00:22:08,610 --> 00:22:10,070
It's huge...

278
00:22:14,660 --> 00:22:17,410
What in the world is going on?

279
00:22:18,790 --> 00:22:22,500
I-I don't believe it!
It's a--

280
00:22:27,800 --> 00:22:30,890
A huge face...?

281
00:22:30,970 --> 00:22:34,970

00:23:46,180 --> 00:23:52,700

</font>Is there light in the world outside?

293
00:24:05,480 --> 00:24:08,480
<b>Next Time</b>

294
00:24:06,820 --> 00:24:10,360
I've come all this way,
just to tell him this.

295
00:24:10,900 --> 00:24:13,950
That the other humans and I have
just as much right to be on this world.

296
00:24:14,360 --> 00:24:19,540
Next time on Gurren Lagann,
"I Will Head Towards Tomorrow".
