00:00:10,670 --> 00:00:15,470
Gurren Lagann

2
00:00:15,470 --> 00:00:20,780
<font color=#FFFF00>Sugita kisetsu wo nageku hima ha nai
</font>I don't have the time to lament the seasons that have passed

3
00:00:20,780 --> 00:00:26,350
<font color=#FFFF00>Nido to mayotte shimawanu you ni
</font>So that I won't ever waver again

4
00:00:26,350 --> 00:00:31,660
<font color=#FFFF00>Kazoekirenai hon no sasayaka na
</font>With countless, tiny little

5
00:00:31,660 --> 00:00:36,560
<font color=#FFFF00>Sonna koukai kakaeta mama
</font>Regrets carried in my arms

6
00:00:36,660 --> 00:00:42,640
<font color=#FFFF00>Sono senaka dake oikakete koko made kitanda
</font>I've come this far, having chased only after your back

7
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:48,040
<font color=#FFFF00>Sagashite ita boku dake ni dekiru koto
</font>It's something only I, who sought you, can do

8
00:00:48,100 --> 00:00:53,110
<font color=#FFFF00>Ano hi kureta kotoba ga ima demo
</font>Those words you gave me that day, even now,

9
00:00:53,200 --> 00:00:58,940
<font color=#FFFF00>Kono mune ni tashika ni todoite iru kara
</font>Definitely reach my heart

10
00:00:59,050 --> 00:01:04,210
<font color=#FFFF00>Kinou yori mo kyou ha bu ha boku no
</font>I've realized my reason for having been born

11
00:01:04,250 --> 00:01:09,960
<font color=#FFFF00>Umarete kita wake ni kidzuite yuku
</font>Today more than I did yesterday

12
00:01:10,100 --> 00:01:18,830
<font color=#FFFF00>Kotae ha sou itsumo koko ni aru
</font>The answer, yes, is always right here

13
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:34,840
This is the tale of a man who blows
a hole in the fate of a universe...

14
00:01:34,920 --> 00:01:37,380
...that is ruled by the endless
cycle of violence.

15
00:01:37,630 --> 00:01:40,800
The Super Galaxy Dai-Gurren had
been swallowed up by a dark sea.

16
00:01:40,890 --> 00:01:45,520
What saved them from being crushed
in this graveyard of Spiral warriors...

17
00:01:45,730 --> 00:01:49,060
...was the flash of light given off
by the end of Kittan's life.

18
00:01:49,310 --> 00:01:54,270
Kittan... I accept your last wish!

19
00:02:02,200 --> 00:02:04,450
Our friend's hopes and dreams
are etched into its body...

20
00:02:04,790 --> 00:02:07,580
Transforming the infinite darkness
into light!

21
00:02:08,830 --> 00:02:12,630
Unmatched in heaven and Earth...
One machine, equal to the gods!

22
00:02:13,290 --> 00:02:17,510
Super Galaxy Gurren Lagann!

23
00:02:20,300 --> 00:02:23,140
We're gonna show you
the power...

24
00:02:26,810 --> 00:02:29,640
...of the human race!

25
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:44,120
<b>Episode 26:
Let's Go, Buddy</b>

26
00:03:03,010 --> 00:03:04,090
What's happening?

27
00:03:04,220 --> 00:03:08,560
A powerful Spiral field is completely
neutralizing the enemy attacks!

28
00:03:09,100 --> 00:03:10,270
Of course it is!

29
00:03:10,940 --> 00:03:14,100
As if little pebbles like those
will work on us!

30
00:03:17,230 --> 00:03:18,610
Gurren Boomerang!

31
00:03:19,070 --> 00:03:23,200
Super Galaxy Mega Cutter!

32
00:03:32,040 --> 00:03:34,000
That's Simon's power...?

33
00:03:34,130 --> 00:03:35,880
Incredible...

34
00:03:40,800 --> 00:03:44,130
Weren't you listening?
Those little things won't--

35
00:03:47,310 --> 00:03:48,220
What happened?!

36
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:51,640
Unknown! Spiral field
is holding steady!

37
00:03:51,770 --> 00:03:54,940
According to my monitor, the attack
is being blocked completely!

38
00:03:55,520 --> 00:03:57,190
But they're hitting us!

39
00:03:57,610 --> 00:03:59,440
Probability Alteration Missiles.

40
00:03:59,780 --> 00:04:03,200
They are negating the probability
of us blocking their attack.

41
00:04:03,740 --> 00:04:08,700
They can manipulate probability, too?
But that's God's domain...

42
00:04:12,410 --> 00:04:13,160
What's that?

43
00:04:14,330 --> 00:04:17,960
You would sacrifice one of your own
in order to go forward?

44
00:04:18,040 --> 00:04:20,880
Such is the past karma
of the people of the Spiral.

45
00:04:21,050 --> 00:04:24,760
And it is precisely because of that karma
that you must be destroyed.

46
00:04:24,840 --> 00:04:29,890
Get real! As if we'd accept extinction
over a bunch of gibberish like that!

47
00:04:30,060 --> 00:04:31,600
Then watch.

48
00:04:31,890 --> 00:04:33,890
Watch where this universe
is headed.

49
00:04:33,980 --> 00:04:37,100
See the universe destroyed
by the power of the Spiral,

50
00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:40,650
...which thinks only
of evolving.

51
00:04:44,900 --> 00:04:48,990
Spiral Power is the force which binds
together lifeforms and the universe.

52
00:04:49,490 --> 00:04:52,790
The growth of galaxies is proportional
to the growth of life.

53
00:04:53,160 --> 00:04:55,870
Life developed in search of forms
that would help it acquire...

54
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,580
...even more power
of the Spiral.

55
00:04:57,670 --> 00:05:00,500
This is evolution.

56
00:05:00,630 --> 00:05:04,130
But the end result would be a loss
of control over their Spiral Power,

57
00:05:04,220 --> 00:05:06,720
...and all life becoming
its own galaxy.

58
00:05:07,010 --> 00:05:11,140
These mega galaxies would then devour
each other, forming a black hole,

59
00:05:11,220 --> 00:05:13,520
...and then this universe
would return to nothingness.

60
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:17,640
This is the Spiral Nemesis.

61
00:05:29,200 --> 00:05:31,070
I don't believe it...
It can't be.

62
00:05:31,410 --> 00:05:34,240
What's the matter, Simon?
He's bluffing!

63
00:05:34,370 --> 00:05:35,950
How can you swallow
that garbage?!

64
00:05:36,040 --> 00:05:39,500
Unfortunately, what he says
is the truth, Viral.

65
00:05:39,830 --> 00:05:44,250
Those who use the power of the Spiral
know this better than anyone.

66
00:05:44,710 --> 00:05:47,340
Simon has realized this
on an intuitive level.

67
00:05:47,470 --> 00:05:51,470
He knows that the Anti-Spiral
speaks the truth.

68
00:05:51,510 --> 00:05:54,470
However, there is
one other truth.

69
00:05:54,600 --> 00:05:58,640
And that truth is that Nia is
out there waiting for you.

70
00:05:59,350 --> 00:06:04,400
That she is hanging on so that the Spiral
races and Earth won't be annihilated.

71
00:06:04,860 --> 00:06:08,110
Yeah. That's right.
You're exactly right!

72
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:11,660
What foolishness.

73
00:06:11,740 --> 00:06:15,540
You would risk destroying the universe
for the sake of a fleeting emotion?

74
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,500
You're wrong!
I'll protect them both!

75
00:06:18,790 --> 00:06:21,580
The girl! The universe!
Both of them!

76
00:06:21,960 --> 00:06:25,420
I don't want fear of a tomorrow that might
never be to keep me from acting right now.

77
00:06:25,710 --> 00:06:28,510
That's how Team Dai-Gurren rolls!

78
00:06:39,980 --> 00:06:41,560
Enemy reading has disappeared!

79
00:06:41,690 --> 00:06:46,400
Be careful. They will use a Random
SchrÃ¶dinger Warp to sneak up on us.

80
00:06:46,570 --> 00:06:48,860
Have a heart! Would you please talk
using words we can understand?!

81
00:06:49,200 --> 00:06:52,160
They are manipulating multidimensional
probability fluctuations.

82
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:55,120
They will attack as they shift
up and down the time axis.

83
00:06:55,240 --> 00:06:56,790
How is that any clearer?!

84
00:06:57,250 --> 00:06:59,370
Who cares?!
Just cut loose!

85
00:06:59,460 --> 00:07:00,790
Understood.

86
00:07:01,330 --> 00:07:04,250
Preparing barrage against all possible
points along space and time axes.

87
00:07:12,550 --> 00:07:14,640
I am tracing the enemy.

88
00:07:15,140 --> 00:07:17,260
You mean the time range
can also be broadened?

89
00:07:17,350 --> 00:07:19,680
Probability space where
enemy units exist:

90
00:07:19,730 --> 00:07:23,480
Near past, -10.
Near future, +8.

91
00:07:23,560 --> 00:07:26,480
Enemy units detected!
Count, off the charts!

92
00:07:26,730 --> 00:07:28,440
Will the main cannon work?

93
00:07:28,530 --> 00:07:29,690
Leave that to us!

94
00:07:29,820 --> 00:07:31,700
I don't care about all
that probability stuff,

95
00:07:31,820 --> 00:07:35,070
...I say we teach 'em a lesson in
how stubborn Team Dai-Gurren is!

96
00:07:35,370 --> 00:07:36,870
The lady's right!

97
00:07:37,370 --> 00:07:39,870
Maelstrom Cannon,
ready to fire!

98
00:07:40,250 --> 00:07:42,960
Mega Vortex Cannon,
standing by!

99
00:07:43,330 --> 00:07:46,630
The gauge is saying something
about a "Planck Time Coefficient"...

100
00:07:46,710 --> 00:07:48,710
Ignore it! Just lock
onto the targets!

101
00:07:49,050 --> 00:07:51,630
It means it's determined the probability
change and will get a bulls-eye!

102
00:07:52,010 --> 00:07:56,300
All right, let's do it! Let's punch holes
in the past and future all at once!

103
00:08:06,440 --> 00:08:08,230
Well, how about that?

104
00:08:08,610 --> 00:08:11,650
There's so much power in our engine
that it's like a galaxy's about to be born!

105
00:08:14,530 --> 00:08:17,660
They can't run or hide
from us anymore.

106
00:08:17,950 --> 00:08:20,660
Simon, I know you've been
hanging in there for a long time.

107
00:08:20,790 --> 00:08:23,120
So don't worry about us, and
cut loose as much as you want!

108
00:08:23,710 --> 00:08:25,580
I'll take you up
on that!

109
00:08:28,840 --> 00:08:30,590
SUPER GALAXY...

110
00:08:31,090 --> 00:08:35,380
...GIGA DRILL BREAK!

111
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:08,670
- Nia!
- The interference from the fake is gone.

112
00:09:08,790 --> 00:09:11,550
We can jump straight to where
the real Nia is this time.

113
00:09:11,920 --> 00:09:13,000
Right.

114
00:09:17,930 --> 00:09:19,340
I see her!

115
00:09:20,300 --> 00:09:21,390
Simon...

116
00:09:22,140 --> 00:09:23,430
What the--?

117
00:09:23,520 --> 00:09:27,310
You see beauty in struggling
to the bitter end.

118
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:31,060
This must be instinctive to those
bewitched by the power of the Spiral...

119
00:09:31,230 --> 00:09:35,150
Nevertheless, that is an act which has
been repeated time and time again.

120
00:09:35,530 --> 00:09:38,820
Now, follow the same fate as
all those Spiral warriors...

121
00:09:39,950 --> 00:09:41,450
...who came before you!

122
00:09:44,120 --> 00:09:45,500
What the--?

123
00:09:55,510 --> 00:09:59,010
<font color=#FFC9B9>Gurren Lagann</font>

124
00:10:00,510 --> 00:10:04,010
<font color=#FFC9B9>Gurren Lagann</font>

125
00:10:04,770 --> 00:10:08,440
Digging tunnels.
Day after day, that's my job.

126
00:10:10,440 --> 00:10:14,360
When yesterday was, or where tomorrow is,
it's got nothing to do with me.

127
00:10:15,400 --> 00:10:17,690
How's it coming, Simon?

128
00:10:18,490 --> 00:10:20,570
Just a little further, Bro.

129
00:10:20,820 --> 00:10:24,330
I'm counting on ya, Simon.
Your drill is the only thing I CAN count on.

130
00:10:30,420 --> 00:10:32,750
This is awesome!

131
00:10:38,670 --> 00:10:40,720
That went off without
a hitch, Simon!

132
00:10:43,970 --> 00:10:45,430
Can you believe this?

133
00:10:45,560 --> 00:10:48,560
With this much loot, we'll be able
to live the high life for a while!

134
00:10:48,730 --> 00:10:51,100
Here ya go!
C'mon, don't be shy!

135
00:10:51,230 --> 00:10:53,360
This is your cut,
blood brother!

136
00:10:55,230 --> 00:10:56,440
Sure.

137
00:10:58,240 --> 00:11:01,400
Well? Wasn't it a good idea
to get out of Giha Village?

138
00:11:01,700 --> 00:11:05,370
We're still underground, but we can
live like kings here under the Capital!

139
00:11:05,910 --> 00:11:06,740
Yeah!

140
00:11:06,870 --> 00:11:11,370
We'll never have it as good as the Beastmen,
but stealing their valuables in secret...

141
00:11:11,710 --> 00:11:13,500
...sure makes our lives here
pretty comfy.

142
00:11:13,670 --> 00:11:17,340
You dig, I steal.
Here's to a long partnership, Simon!

143
00:11:19,760 --> 00:11:21,340
Sure thing, Bro!

144
00:11:21,930 --> 00:11:24,430
- I will go down with the ship.
- Captain!

145
00:11:25,180 --> 00:11:26,810
You are worth far more
than jewels to me--

146
00:11:27,220 --> 00:11:28,560
Dishes get clean and--

147
00:11:29,180 --> 00:11:31,350
Have a taste of our ray guns!

148
00:11:32,060 --> 00:11:35,900
We interrupt our regular programming to
bring you news of a crime in progress.

149
00:11:35,980 --> 00:11:40,110
A bank robber is on the run in Siton
Region, firing wildly as he goes.

150
00:11:41,820 --> 00:11:43,910
I want money!
I want food!

151
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:46,740
Hurry it up!

152
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:54,500
We now have footage
from the scene!

153
00:11:55,420 --> 00:11:59,670
Why, that's... It's that mysterious,
elusive bounty hunter!

154
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:01,920
She calls herself Yoko Littner!

155
00:12:05,090 --> 00:12:06,510
Come on!

156
00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:08,140
Everything's okay now.

157
00:12:08,220 --> 00:12:11,180
- Thank you!
- Thanks a lot, lady!

158
00:12:12,810 --> 00:12:14,640
Don't mention it.

159
00:12:20,650 --> 00:12:22,110
What's this?

160
00:12:30,540 --> 00:12:32,660
What in the world is happening?

161
00:12:33,620 --> 00:12:35,500
- It can't be!
- Oh, but it is.

162
00:12:36,040 --> 00:12:38,420
It is exactly as you suspect,
Lordgenome.

163
00:12:39,460 --> 00:12:42,670
They are all being held prisoner
in extradimensional space.

164
00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:44,970
They are trapped in
a series of universes...

165
00:12:45,090 --> 00:12:48,050
...that are created instant to instant
as they are perceived.

166
00:12:48,350 --> 00:12:52,810
So long as they have intelligence,
they will never be able to break free.

167
00:12:52,930 --> 00:12:55,600
So, you are the Anti-Spiral?

168
00:12:55,690 --> 00:12:57,850
Yes. I am.

169
00:12:58,190 --> 00:13:01,860
So, a man once renowned throughout
the galaxy as a Spiral warrior...

170
00:13:01,940 --> 00:13:03,820
...is now reduced
to a biocomputer?

171
00:13:04,070 --> 00:13:06,860
I see that your companions
will also take any action...

172
00:13:06,990 --> 00:13:09,120
...they deem necessary
to achieve their aims.

173
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:12,990
Even so, I was defeated
by you.

174
00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:15,500
I failed to protect
the galaxy.

175
00:13:15,790 --> 00:13:20,710
If it weren't for them, I wouldn't have
been able to face you directly in battle.

176
00:13:22,090 --> 00:13:24,260
You came all the way here
to the space between...

177
00:13:24,340 --> 00:13:29,220
...the 10th and 11th dimensions
so that we could finish you?

178
00:13:29,300 --> 00:13:31,010
So, that is what
this is about.

179
00:13:37,690 --> 00:13:40,230
I must say, you are being
oddly considerate.

180
00:13:41,270 --> 00:13:43,690
TOO considerate, one might say.

181
00:13:45,030 --> 00:13:47,820
Why in the world would you employ
such elaborate, indirect methods?

182
00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:52,700
If you fought with all your might,
exterminating us Spiral races...

183
00:13:52,990 --> 00:13:54,490
...would be a trivial matter.

184
00:13:54,620 --> 00:13:57,620
We detected an unknown
source of Spiral Power.

185
00:13:57,710 --> 00:14:00,920
Gaps in our analysis could
potentially ruin everything.

186
00:14:11,470 --> 00:14:12,680
What?

187
00:14:12,810 --> 00:14:15,680
The unusual Spiral Power source
we detected, it was you?

188
00:14:25,110 --> 00:14:26,480
It took humanoid form?

189
00:14:26,570 --> 00:14:27,740
Ah, I see...

190
00:14:27,860 --> 00:14:31,820
You converted your individual growth
energy into species evolution energy?

191
00:14:31,910 --> 00:14:34,080
But it should not be possible
for an individual...

192
00:14:34,200 --> 00:14:36,620
...to undergo such an
extreme transformation.

193
00:14:37,080 --> 00:14:39,910
It's all because of your
Spiral Power, Lordgenome.

194
00:14:40,040 --> 00:14:42,210
My power... did this?

195
00:14:44,090 --> 00:14:46,130
Get back, Anti-Spiral!

196
00:14:46,300 --> 00:14:48,210
I won't let you lay
a hand on Simon!

197
00:14:54,430 --> 00:14:57,140
You have shown me a most
interesting phenomenon.

198
00:14:57,850 --> 00:14:59,850
But evolving was a mistake.

199
00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:02,190
Wait a minute, this is--

200
00:15:02,310 --> 00:15:05,440
The instant extradimensional space
is perceived, it is made real.

201
00:15:05,860 --> 00:15:08,440
Taking human form
means that you have...

202
00:15:08,570 --> 00:15:12,450
...trapped yourself in the labyrinth
of extradimensional space.

203
00:15:12,780 --> 00:15:14,160
Simon...

204
00:15:15,740 --> 00:15:18,200
The last of the gaps
have now been filled in.

205
00:15:18,870 --> 00:15:22,210
You will never generate
Spiral Power again.

206
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:25,460
You are finished.

207
00:15:37,260 --> 00:15:39,970
We're sorry! What we did was wrong!
Forgive us!

208
00:15:40,100 --> 00:15:41,680
Okay? Look, I'm on
my knees!

209
00:15:41,850 --> 00:15:44,190
Have mercy on us!
What we did was wrong!

210
00:15:44,360 --> 00:15:47,820
We'll do whatever you say! If you say
to bow a million times, we'll do it!

211
00:15:47,940 --> 00:15:49,820
We're sorry, we're sorry,
we're sorry, we're sorry!

212
00:15:49,940 --> 00:15:53,570
So please, don't kill us!
Just spare our lives!

213
00:16:02,580 --> 00:16:04,540
What's the matter, Simon?

214
00:16:08,800 --> 00:16:10,590
You lose your drill?

215
00:16:12,680 --> 00:16:14,300
There's another Bro...

216
00:16:14,470 --> 00:16:15,800
Dumbass!

217
00:16:17,510 --> 00:16:20,310
The bad reputation of Team Gurren
echoes far and wide in Giha Village!

218
00:16:20,390 --> 00:16:24,730
Its badass leader is a man of indomitable
spirit, a paragon of masculinity!

219
00:16:25,230 --> 00:16:28,480
As if there could be more than one
of the mighty Kamina!

220
00:16:28,900 --> 00:16:31,150
But there's two of you here.

221
00:16:31,490 --> 00:16:33,610
Exactly! Pick the one
you prefer.

222
00:16:33,700 --> 00:16:35,070
But that's crazy!

223
00:16:35,530 --> 00:16:39,200
Don't you remember? You were the one
who was the method to my madness!

224
00:16:39,490 --> 00:16:42,700
The one who made my big talk
more than words!

225
00:16:43,410 --> 00:16:46,420
Your drill oughta be totally different
from that pebble over there.

226
00:16:46,540 --> 00:16:47,750
I'm sorry! Forgive me!

227
00:16:47,840 --> 00:16:49,630
Your drill is right here.

228
00:16:49,710 --> 00:16:52,170
You can't keep wasting time
in here forever!

229
00:16:52,590 --> 00:16:55,130
What's that drill of yours
meant to do?

230
00:16:56,640 --> 00:16:58,760
Bro?
Is it really you?

231
00:16:59,300 --> 00:17:01,140
Hey, what are you doing?!

232
00:17:01,220 --> 00:17:02,890
Start bowing, too!

233
00:17:03,350 --> 00:17:05,310
Bow and beg and scrape...

234
00:17:05,390 --> 00:17:07,100
...and pretend to apologize to
get them to turn a blind eye!

235
00:17:07,230 --> 00:17:08,150
...and we'll
get through this!

236
00:17:08,150 --> 00:17:08,730
My...
...and we'll
get through this!

237
00:17:08,730 --> 00:17:09,310
My...
If they let us go, we can always
come up with something else!

238
00:17:09,310 --> 00:17:11,520
If they let us go, we can always
come up with something else!

239
00:17:11,650 --> 00:17:13,530
Look, just keep your
head down and apologize!

240
00:17:13,610 --> 00:17:15,780
My drill is...

241
00:17:16,990 --> 00:17:19,620
My drill...

242
00:17:21,290 --> 00:17:24,540
...is the drill that's gonna
pierce the heavens!

243
00:17:33,800 --> 00:17:36,220
My drill is my soul.

244
00:17:55,150 --> 00:17:56,780
Get going, Simon.

245
00:17:56,900 --> 00:18:00,740
Don't let the what-if's, maybe's
and if-only's distract you.

246
00:18:00,870 --> 00:18:05,330
The one thing that you chose yourself,
THAT is the truth of your universe.

247
00:18:07,410 --> 00:18:11,250
Yeah. You're right.
That's exactly right.

248
00:18:11,340 --> 00:18:14,920
Don't forget. My universe is
the universe that's in here.

249
00:18:17,550 --> 00:18:18,840
Bro...

250
00:18:19,260 --> 00:18:21,840
It's not just me.
It's these bozos, too.

251
00:18:31,060 --> 00:18:33,440
Whoa, when the hell did
you get taller than me?

252
00:18:33,570 --> 00:18:34,980
Wow, you're right!

253
00:18:41,490 --> 00:18:43,410
Time for me to leave, Bro.

254
00:18:43,530 --> 00:18:44,620
Yeah.

255
00:18:44,830 --> 00:18:47,750
This time it's really goodbye.

256
00:18:47,830 --> 00:18:49,370
Get going, blood brother.

257
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:53,330
This isn't goodbye.
You're always with me, right?

258
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:55,460
Yeah!

259
00:19:18,110 --> 00:19:20,030
Let's go, buddy!

260
00:19:29,040 --> 00:19:31,500
- Teach!
- Thanks, Teach!

261
00:19:32,080 --> 00:19:34,000
- Miss Yomako!
- Miss Yomako!

262
00:19:34,250 --> 00:19:35,500
I-I'm not...

263
00:19:35,590 --> 00:19:39,090
Your teacher is a much
finer lady than her.

264
00:19:39,630 --> 00:19:42,130
The winner of this year's
Miss Littner pageant is Yoko!

265
00:19:42,510 --> 00:19:46,100
It's time for Yoko, the best shot
in the galaxy, to take her turn!

266
00:19:46,350 --> 00:19:49,640
She demonstrated absolutely flawless
technique in the preliminary round!

267
00:19:50,770 --> 00:19:53,600
That dress looks
wonderful on you.

268
00:20:03,660 --> 00:20:05,320
Thanks.

269
00:20:09,910 --> 00:20:11,000
Well, I'm off.

270
00:20:40,690 --> 00:20:42,240
Here, Daddy...

271
00:20:50,950 --> 00:20:52,790
Oh, now I get it.

272
00:20:53,160 --> 00:20:56,670
I was having
a sappy dream, too.

273
00:21:06,890 --> 00:21:09,850
Your actions are baffling, Irregular.

274
00:21:09,970 --> 00:21:12,010
Why do you resist me so?

275
00:21:12,640 --> 00:21:15,520
He will come.
You can be sure of that.

276
00:21:15,600 --> 00:21:17,690
You appear to have been tainted
by the power of the Spiral...

277
00:21:17,810 --> 00:21:20,610
...and given a strange sort
of self-awareness.

278
00:21:20,690 --> 00:21:24,940
However, the time left to you
has now run out.

279
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:22,920
Simon!

280
00:22:28,760 --> 00:22:30,970
Sorry I kept you waiting, Nia!
