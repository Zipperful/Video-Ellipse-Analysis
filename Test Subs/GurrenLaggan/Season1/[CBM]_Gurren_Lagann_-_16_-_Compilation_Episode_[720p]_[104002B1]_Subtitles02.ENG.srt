00:00:15,580 --> 00:00:18,110
<font color=#FFFF00>Kimi ha kikoeru?
</font>Can you hear it?

3
00:00:18,250 --> 00:00:26,250
<font color=#FFFF00>Boku no kono koe ga yami ni munashiku suikomareta
</font>This voice of mine was sucked emptily into darkness

4
00:00:26,600 --> 00:00:31,700
<font color=#FFFF00>Moshimo sekai ga imi wo motsu no nara
</font>If the world has meaning to it,

5
00:00:32,030 --> 00:00:36,570
<font color=#FFFF00>Konna kimochi mo muda de ha nai
</font>Then these kinds of feelings aren't futile

6
00:00:36,910 --> 00:00:42,610
<font color=#FFFF00>Akogare ni oshitsubusarete akirametetanda
</font>I was crushed by my longing and had given up

7
00:00:42,910 --> 00:00:47,870
<font color=#FFFF00>Hateshinai sora no iro mo shiranaide
</font>Without even knowing the color of the endless sky

8
00:00:48,280 --> 00:00:53,190
<font color=#FFFF00>Hashiridashita omoi ga ima demo
</font>I began to run, because my feelings, even now,

9
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:58,960
<font color=#FFFF00>Kono mune wo tashika ni tataiteru kara
</font>Are definitely beating against my heart

10
00:00:59,230 --> 00:01:04,030
<font color=#FFFF00>Kyou no boku ga sono saki ni tsudzuku
</font>The me of today will continue towards our destination

11
00:01:04,500 --> 00:01:10,060
<font color=#FFFF00>Bokura nari no asu wo kizuite yuku
</font>We'll amass our own tomorrows

12
00:01:10,410 --> 00:01:18,900
<font color=#FFFF00>Kotae ha sou itsumo koko ni aru
</font>The answer, yes, is always right here

Compilation Episode

14
00:02:25,770 --> 00:02:28,310
Underground village

15
00:02:29,770 --> 00:02:32,230
Don't call me Kamina,
call me "Bro"!

16
00:02:32,270 --> 00:02:34,770
Day after day...

17
00:02:34,900 --> 00:02:38,030
Yours is the drill that will break
through the vault of heaven!

18
00:02:37,110 --> 00:02:39,610
...he digs through the dirt.

19
00:02:41,530 --> 00:02:43,410
I don't run from anything

20
00:02:42,950 --> 00:02:45,450
His parents are dead.

21
00:02:46,790 --> 00:02:49,960
Oh, right. I forgot what
happened to you.

22
00:02:50,170 --> 00:02:52,420
Up on the surface,
there ain't no ceiling!

23
00:02:52,460 --> 00:02:54,960
Somewhere that isn't here...

24
00:02:57,550 --> 00:02:59,760
When they speak of that
paragon of masculinity,

25
00:03:00,130 --> 00:03:02,470
...they're talking about ME,
the mighty Kamina!

26
00:03:02,510 --> 00:03:05,010
...there's a wide open world.

27
00:03:05,350 --> 00:03:09,180
Dumbass! Reject common sense to
make the impossible possible!

28
00:03:09,270 --> 00:03:12,140
That's the way
Team Gurren rolls, right?

29
00:03:12,190 --> 00:03:14,650
He's tough, kind, and big.

30
00:03:14,690 --> 00:03:18,110
Farewell, Giha Village!
We're off to the surface!

31
00:03:18,530 --> 00:03:20,320
Off to the surface
I saw as a kid!

32
00:03:20,360 --> 00:03:22,860
I want to be like my Bro.

33
00:03:23,740 --> 00:03:26,330
I'm Kamina,
and this is Simon.

34
00:03:29,330 --> 00:03:30,910
Listen up, you walking faces!

35
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:34,710
Having left his homeland, he never yields,
never retreats, and never regrets!

36
00:03:34,750 --> 00:03:37,250
He was still a child.

37
00:03:37,670 --> 00:03:40,550
When you're ready,
come up and join me.

38
00:03:41,590 --> 00:03:45,470
Until then!
Goodbye for now, Kamina!

39
00:03:47,430 --> 00:03:49,930
His father's back.

40
00:03:50,310 --> 00:03:52,730
You got here just in time,
blood brother!

41
00:03:56,110 --> 00:03:58,610
He takes over...

42
00:03:59,150 --> 00:04:02,030
That body gives me chills
every time I look at it!

43
00:04:02,360 --> 00:04:04,990
Oh, yeah! It's all about
the fighting spirit!

44
00:04:11,500 --> 00:04:14,000
...an enemy Gunmen!

45
00:04:14,370 --> 00:04:17,040
Let's see some more spirit!

46
00:04:44,450 --> 00:04:47,160
Don't screw with me,
you Gunmen bastards!

47
00:04:48,700 --> 00:04:52,450
Who the hell do you
think I am?!

48
00:05:03,260 --> 00:05:05,220
All right, you two!
Get back!

49
00:05:09,720 --> 00:05:11,310
You came from
the surface, right?

50
00:05:11,390 --> 00:05:12,180
Pretty much.

51
00:05:12,270 --> 00:05:15,560
That's awesome. So, that's a weapon
they use on the surface, huh?

52
00:05:13,100 --> 00:05:15,560
A dangerous woman.

53
00:05:15,730 --> 00:05:20,480
Damn, you got a fine body!
Surface chicks are a breed apart!

54
00:05:19,610 --> 00:05:22,110
A new companion.

55
00:05:21,230 --> 00:05:22,110
It's Yoko.

56
00:05:22,730 --> 00:05:26,530
That's my name.
I never introduced myself, did I?

57
00:05:26,990 --> 00:05:29,660
Hold us steady, Simon!

58
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:35,580
Hold us steady, I said!
Sheesh!

59
00:05:42,130 --> 00:05:44,760
A powerful rival...

60
00:05:46,760 --> 00:05:51,260
Human Eradication Forces,
Far East Theater Commander Viral.

61
00:05:51,300 --> 00:05:53,810
...appears!

62
00:05:54,470 --> 00:05:55,850
You're not getting away!

63
00:05:57,230 --> 00:05:59,190
I never turn my back
on an enemy!

64
00:05:59,270 --> 00:06:02,400
That bravado will
get you killed.

65
00:06:10,700 --> 00:06:11,910
What was--

66
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,620
Damn, you dodged it...

67
00:06:17,870 --> 00:06:20,620
Impressive, you managed
to injure me.

68
00:06:20,710 --> 00:06:24,290
But a sneak attack is just a sneak attack.
It's only a surprise once.

69
00:06:25,960 --> 00:06:27,380
It's over!

70
00:06:27,670 --> 00:06:30,180
A showdown at high noon.

71
00:06:32,850 --> 00:06:34,600
Don't put yourself out
on our account.

72
00:06:34,680 --> 00:06:37,890
If he isn't beaten here,
we'll lose our home.

73
00:06:44,150 --> 00:06:48,900
You're members of Team Gurren!
I'm not gonna let this guy take you out!

74
00:06:50,280 --> 00:06:52,240
You never learn
any new tricks...

75
00:06:52,950 --> 00:06:54,780
...do you?!

76
00:06:54,990 --> 00:06:56,490
On your feet.

77
00:06:58,620 --> 00:07:01,120
Who do you think you are,
having two faces!

78
00:07:04,040 --> 00:07:07,090
Time for the last resort! It's time
to break out the you-know-what!

79
00:07:07,210 --> 00:07:09,460
The what?
Sorry, I don't know what.

80
00:07:09,970 --> 00:07:13,260
Dumbass! What else would
I be talking about?!

81
00:07:13,470 --> 00:07:14,800
We're gonna combine!

82
00:07:14,890 --> 00:07:19,850
Manly combining is about fighting spirit!
The beauty of soaring through the air!

83
00:07:52,260 --> 00:07:58,050
Brotherly Combining!
Gurren Lagann!

84
00:08:04,230 --> 00:08:06,770
You're being awfully understanding!

85
00:08:07,230 --> 00:08:11,110
Warriors of the Capital
prize decorum above all else!

86
00:08:13,200 --> 00:08:14,150
The Capital?

87
00:08:14,280 --> 00:08:19,830
It is the sole example of civilization on
the surface, ruled by the Spiral King!

88
00:08:19,950 --> 00:08:21,080
Spiral King?

89
00:08:21,160 --> 00:08:23,040
Civilization, huh?

90
00:08:21,950 --> 00:08:24,500
Royal Capital

91
00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:28,170
I am one of the Spiral King's
Four Generals...

92
00:08:28,920 --> 00:08:31,380
...Thymilph, the Raging Wave.

93
00:08:30,710 --> 00:08:33,220
Spiral King

94
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:36,430
Yoko, watch my back.

95
00:08:37,140 --> 00:08:40,010
I'll crush anything that comes
at me from up ahead.

96
00:08:40,310 --> 00:08:42,140
So I need you to deal with
anything from behind.

97
00:08:43,940 --> 00:08:45,350
Kamina.

98
00:08:50,650 --> 00:08:53,650
Your back is one big
blind spot, isn't it?

99
00:08:55,110 --> 00:08:56,660
What are you--

100
00:09:11,590 --> 00:09:13,300
I'll pay that back
ten times over.

101
00:09:14,010 --> 00:09:16,010
When we get back,
I'll repay that ten times over.

102
00:09:16,300 --> 00:09:17,970
Mark my words.

103
00:09:21,350 --> 00:09:22,600
What's with you?

104
00:09:23,020 --> 00:09:25,560
Don't you think you could phrase that
a little more romantically?

105
00:09:27,230 --> 00:09:30,440
Now, let's head out there
and raise a little hell!

106
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:32,980
Take over Dai-Gunzan!

107
00:09:33,110 --> 00:09:37,240
We have the edge in spirit, too!
Get in there, Simon!

108
00:09:35,400 --> 00:09:37,900
You're Gonna Do It!

109
00:09:37,240 --> 00:09:39,530
Lagann Impact!

110
00:09:41,490 --> 00:09:45,080
- That was close!
- General Thymilph, you're in danger here!

111
00:09:47,870 --> 00:09:49,830
What are you trying to do?!

112
00:09:49,920 --> 00:09:54,300
We merged 'em! We merged our
Lagann with your Dai-Gunzan!

113
00:09:54,550 --> 00:09:55,550
You've what?!

114
00:09:55,720 --> 00:09:57,920
That behemoth is now ours!

115
00:09:58,130 --> 00:10:00,680
Damn you, Kamina,
you set us up!

116
00:10:02,680 --> 00:10:05,310
Yeah, that I did!

117
00:10:07,310 --> 00:10:10,520
I put our luck and our
mettle to the test!

118
00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:13,110
I can't do it.

119
00:10:13,400 --> 00:10:17,150
You guys keep the Gunmen pinned down!
I'll see what I can do about Simon!

120
00:10:17,240 --> 00:10:18,490
Yeah!

121
00:10:31,580 --> 00:10:33,250
Open the hatch, Simon!

122
00:10:34,750 --> 00:10:36,760
Let's see you grit those teeth!

123
00:10:43,890 --> 00:10:45,510
Bro?

124
00:10:47,060 --> 00:10:49,680
Have you snapped out of it?

125
00:10:50,020 --> 00:10:53,440
If you ever start to doubt yourself,
I'll always come to belt you one.

126
00:10:53,560 --> 00:10:57,320
So don't worry,
I'm here at your side.

127
00:10:57,570 --> 00:10:59,030
Believe in yourself.

128
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:02,410
Believe in the Simon
that I have faith in.

129
00:11:02,700 --> 00:11:05,160
I can never be like you, Bro...

130
00:11:07,080 --> 00:11:08,290
You got it!

131
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:17,090
Bro?

132
00:11:17,130 --> 00:11:18,170
Kamina?!

133
00:11:22,180 --> 00:11:27,930
I won't hand over
my Dai-Gunzan so easily!

134
00:11:28,100 --> 00:11:29,810
Thymilph?!
Damn, I didn't--

135
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:55,920
That day, we lost something that
could never be replaced.

136
00:11:57,500 --> 00:12:01,010
Gurren Lagann

137
00:12:02,510 --> 00:12:06,010
Gurren Lagann

138
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:22,690
I can't do it...
I can never be like you, Bro...

139
00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:29,280
They seek out the light,
even though only death awaits them.

140
00:12:30,120 --> 00:12:32,080
It is enough
to make me despair...

141
00:12:33,250 --> 00:12:37,250
...at the nature of these
creatures called humans.

142
00:12:37,290 --> 00:12:39,790
The Spiral King's daughter...

143
00:12:43,760 --> 00:12:46,260
...Nia.

144
00:12:50,010 --> 00:12:51,770
Hail fellow well met!

145
00:12:51,850 --> 00:12:54,770
Why are you
the same as I am?

146
00:12:55,980 --> 00:12:58,440
A meeting amidst despair.

147
00:12:55,980 --> 00:12:58,440
You have no tail,
nor fangs or scales.

148
00:12:59,020 --> 00:13:01,190
Your skin is soft, as well.

149
00:13:01,480 --> 00:13:04,900
Well, that's only natural.
I'm a human being.

150
00:13:04,990 --> 00:13:06,030
"Human being"?

151
00:13:06,110 --> 00:13:09,570
Right. A human being.
A human. A person.

152
00:13:10,790 --> 00:13:14,250
And what, exactly,
is a human?

153
00:13:14,660 --> 00:13:17,750
How do you do?
My name is Nia.

154
00:13:17,880 --> 00:13:19,670
And what is your name?

155
00:13:19,710 --> 00:13:22,250
Enemy pursuit.

156
00:13:22,920 --> 00:13:26,010
There's no escape, human scum.

157
00:13:26,430 --> 00:13:27,930
I know that voice...

158
00:13:30,350 --> 00:13:32,390
Wha--? That idiot, is she trying
to get herself killed?

159
00:13:34,930 --> 00:13:36,560
Stop this, Adiane!

160
00:13:37,020 --> 00:13:40,150
First Princess Nia, daughter of
Spiral King Lordgenome, orders you!

161
00:13:40,360 --> 00:13:42,520
Leave us,
Adiane, the Elegant!

162
00:13:42,730 --> 00:13:45,240
Are you aware of
who I am?

163
00:13:46,450 --> 00:13:48,950
Termination orders.

164
00:13:49,450 --> 00:13:51,320
You piss me off, you flake!

165
00:13:51,410 --> 00:13:53,950
If you wanna go, take your
own sorry ass there!

166
00:13:55,290 --> 00:13:57,620
Do you hate me, as well?

167
00:13:57,710 --> 00:14:00,750
Hate you? I couldn't
care less about you.

168
00:14:03,130 --> 00:14:07,300
I was told to kill you, so that's
what I'm going to do!

169
00:14:07,470 --> 00:14:10,800
Then if my father told you to die,
would you do that, as well?!

170
00:14:12,010 --> 00:14:13,760
You are wrong!

171
00:14:14,600 --> 00:14:17,100
These people have done
nothing wrong!

172
00:14:17,810 --> 00:14:19,850
Don't you think that there is
something wrong with that?

173
00:14:20,060 --> 00:14:22,190
NO, I DON'T!

174
00:14:21,560 --> 00:14:24,070
Your father says he has
grown tired of you.

175
00:14:24,610 --> 00:14:26,070
Like a doll?

176
00:14:28,740 --> 00:14:34,030
I'm told that you asked him,
"Why was I born?"

177
00:14:34,120 --> 00:14:38,620
That was a bad move. His Majesty
detests human self-awareness.

178
00:14:36,120 --> 00:14:38,620
The valley of discarded princesses.

179
00:14:38,750 --> 00:14:43,750
Who can blame him? Why would a puppet,
a plaything, need self-awareness?

180
00:14:48,170 --> 00:14:51,760
I am just like that doll...

181
00:14:52,930 --> 00:14:56,260
That's right. And once he grows tired
of them, they're discarded.

182
00:14:56,640 --> 00:14:59,100
Just like you were.

183
00:15:11,860 --> 00:15:14,410
Simon will protect me.

184
00:15:14,580 --> 00:15:15,580
Simon.

185
00:15:16,160 --> 00:15:20,750
You aren't your Bro, Simon.
I think you should just be yourself.

186
00:15:22,370 --> 00:15:26,170
Listen, Simon. Never forget this.
Believe in yourself.

187
00:15:26,750 --> 00:15:28,550
Not in the Simon
that I have faith in.

188
00:15:28,920 --> 00:15:30,800
Not in the Kamina
that you believe in, either.

189
00:15:31,220 --> 00:15:34,010
- Believe in the Simon--
- ...who believes in you!

190
00:15:38,640 --> 00:15:41,140
He won't lose to the likes of you.

191
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:43,100
I believe in Simon, too!

192
00:15:50,320 --> 00:15:53,280
Nia! I'm here to rescue you!
Come on!

193
00:15:56,700 --> 00:15:58,410
Simon!

194
00:15:58,700 --> 00:16:01,200
Sorry I took so long.

195
00:16:01,500 --> 00:16:03,000
I understand now!

196
00:16:03,330 --> 00:16:06,330
So do I.
Thank you, Simon!

197
00:16:07,210 --> 00:16:09,800
My Bro is dead.
He's gone.

198
00:16:10,090 --> 00:16:13,420
But he's on my back!
In my heart!

199
00:16:13,470 --> 00:16:15,970
Believe in yourself!

200
00:16:13,470 --> 00:16:15,970
He lives on as part of me!

201
00:16:19,140 --> 00:16:21,560
If you're gonna dig,
dig to breach the heavens.

202
00:16:21,640 --> 00:16:23,640
Even if it's my own grave
I'm digging, I keep going!

203
00:16:23,730 --> 00:16:26,190
Once I've dug my way through,
that means I've won!

204
00:16:26,520 --> 00:16:29,190
What? What are you
talking about?

205
00:16:29,270 --> 00:16:31,110
Who the hell do
you think I am?

206
00:16:31,650 --> 00:16:32,860
I'm Simon.

207
00:16:33,450 --> 00:16:36,780
I'm not my Bro, Kamina.
I'm ME!

208
00:16:37,240 --> 00:16:39,280
Simon the Digger!

209
00:16:41,450 --> 00:16:43,370
Finishing Move!

210
00:16:47,290 --> 00:16:48,630
That move, it was--

211
00:16:58,930 --> 00:17:07,100
GIGA DRILL BREAK!

212
00:17:18,990 --> 00:17:21,490
The invincible drill.

213
00:17:21,830 --> 00:17:24,120
Put Nia down!

214
00:17:27,620 --> 00:17:29,330
General Adiane!

215
00:17:31,800 --> 00:17:33,760
No you don't!

216
00:17:37,720 --> 00:17:40,220
The power of the Spiral.

217
00:17:52,610 --> 00:17:55,110
Reawakened humans...

218
00:17:56,990 --> 00:17:59,990
Damn you, Gurren Lagann!

219
00:18:00,070 --> 00:18:02,450
Damn! DAMN!

220
00:18:02,490 --> 00:18:04,990
...go on the offensive.

221
00:18:05,160 --> 00:18:09,620
The time has finally come
to demonstrate my power.

222
00:18:10,750 --> 00:18:14,500
Spiral King Lordgenome,
watch closely!

223
00:18:16,340 --> 00:18:18,670
All units, advance!

224
00:18:28,600 --> 00:18:31,100
A rout.

225
00:18:31,270 --> 00:18:32,480
It worked!

226
00:18:43,740 --> 00:18:47,250
How can this be?! How can
I be losing to a mere human cub?!

227
00:18:52,250 --> 00:18:55,000
What are humans?

228
00:18:59,880 --> 00:19:03,680
Do you really wish
to know the answer?

229
00:19:04,470 --> 00:19:06,560
Do you, Viral?

230
00:19:08,430 --> 00:19:09,770
Yes!

231
00:19:14,610 --> 00:19:20,780
I can never be you, but I'm going off
to do what only I can do.

232
00:19:25,330 --> 00:19:28,540
The things that only
Simon the Digger can do.

233
00:19:55,060 --> 00:19:57,570
Towards the final battle...

234
00:20:13,620 --> 00:20:17,340
What's the matter?
Has your Spiral run dry?

235
00:20:18,130 --> 00:20:19,170
Simon!

236
00:20:19,250 --> 00:20:22,760
Simon, if our faith in you
is what gives you your strength,

237
00:20:23,470 --> 00:20:25,890
...then I'll believe in you
with all my heart!

238
00:20:26,220 --> 00:20:28,140
So, please! Win!

239
00:20:30,890 --> 00:20:33,390
The Spiral King, Lordgenome

240
00:20:35,690 --> 00:20:38,900
I haven't had this much fun
in a long time, boy.

241
00:20:40,610 --> 00:20:42,690
Now, back into the dirt
with you!

242
00:20:47,620 --> 00:20:49,370
A Core Drill?!

243
00:20:50,080 --> 00:20:52,790
And that something
is my drill!

244
00:21:03,720 --> 00:21:09,720
I see... Your Spiral Power
outstripped my own.

245
00:21:10,680 --> 00:21:12,100
Lordgenome...

246
00:21:12,220 --> 00:21:14,600
I will leave you with
this warning.

247
00:21:14,690 --> 00:21:17,940
When the land comes to overflow
with a million apes,

248
00:21:18,060 --> 00:21:23,190
...the moon shall become Hell's messenger
and destroy the world of the Spiral.

249
00:21:24,150 --> 00:21:25,650
What do you mean?!

250
00:21:28,910 --> 00:21:30,450
Father!

251
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:51,010
Farewell, Father.

252
00:21:52,220 --> 00:21:54,850
I will head towards tomorrow.

253
00:21:54,890 --> 00:21:57,390
The royal capital Teppelin...

254
00:22:03,320 --> 00:22:05,820
...falls.

255
00:22:14,410 --> 00:22:16,910
Humanity...

256
00:22:25,920 --> 00:22:28,420
...has broken through the heavens.

257
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:34,100
And beyond it lies...

261

272
00:24:06,520 --> 00:24:08,520
Seven years have passed.

273
00:24:08,530 --> 00:24:10,650
People are indulging themselves
in these days of peace,

274
00:24:10,860 --> 00:24:14,200
...not knowing that their empty stomachs
are being filled with the wine of ruin.

Next time on Gurren Lagann,
"You Don't Know Anything".
