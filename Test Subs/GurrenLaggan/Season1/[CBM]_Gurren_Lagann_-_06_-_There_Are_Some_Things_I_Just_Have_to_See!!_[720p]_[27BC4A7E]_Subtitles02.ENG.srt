1
00:00:10,670 --> 00:00:15,510
Gurren Lagann

2
00:00:15,580 --> 00:00:18,110
<font color=#FFFF00>Kimi ha kikoeru?
</font>Can you hear it?

3
00:00:18,250 --> 00:00:26,250
<font color=#FFFF00>Boku no kono koe ga yami ni munashiku suikomareta
</font>This voice of mine was sucked emptily into darkness

4
00:00:26,600 --> 00:00:31,700
<font color=#FFFF00>Moshimo sekai ga imi wo motsu no nara
</font>If the world has meaning to it,

5
00:00:32,030 --> 00:00:36,570
<font color=#FFFF00>Konna kimochi mo muda de ha nai
</font>Then these kinds of feelings aren't futile

6
00:00:36,910 --> 00:00:42,610
<font color=#FFFF00>Akogare ni oshitsubusarete akirametetanda
</font>I was crushed by my longing and had given up

7
00:00:42,910 --> 00:00:47,870
<font color=#FFFF00>Hateshinai sora no iro mo shiranaide
</font>Without even knowing the color of the endless sky

8
00:00:48,280 --> 00:00:53,190
<font color=#FFFF00>Hashiridashita omoi ga ima demo
</font>I began to run, because my feelings, even now,

9
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:58,960
<font color=#FFFF00>Kono mune wo tashika ni tataiteru kara
</font>Are definitely beating against my heart

10
00:00:59,230 --> 00:01:04,030
<font color=#FFFF00>Kyou no boku ga sono saki ni tsudzuku
</font>The me of today will continue towards our destination

11
00:01:04,500 --> 00:01:10,060
<font color=#FFFF00>Bokura nari no asu wo kizuite yuku
</font>We'll amass our own tomorrows

12
00:01:10,410 --> 00:01:18,900
<font color=#FFFF00>Kotae ha sou itsumo koko ni aru
</font>The answer, yes, is always right here

13
00:01:32,250 --> 00:01:37,550
This is the tale of a man who has yet
to realize what his destiny is.

14
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:41,180
Adai, a village that worships
an ancient Gunmen as a god.

15
00:01:41,350 --> 00:01:45,180
That place had a cruel rule meant to
ensure the survival of their people.

16
00:01:45,890 --> 00:01:50,350
Still harboring resentment in their hearts,
Simon and Kamina's journey continues,

17
00:01:50,480 --> 00:01:53,110
...having acquired still more
new companions.

18
00:01:53,650 --> 00:01:59,400
Episode 6:
There are Some Things I Just Have to See!!

19
00:01:59,860 --> 00:02:03,490
I don't see anything around here
that seems like a likely candidate.

20
00:02:03,580 --> 00:02:04,870
No doubt about it.

21
00:02:05,160 --> 00:02:08,580
Judging from this map, the recall
point ought to be right here.

22
00:02:08,670 --> 00:02:11,130
Are you sure
we didn't pass it?

23
00:02:11,250 --> 00:02:17,260
It's hard to believe that we could overlook
a facility large enough to launch Gunmen.

24
00:02:17,880 --> 00:02:21,720
I suppose I need to look over
Gurren's data one more time.

25
00:02:22,140 --> 00:02:22,970
Huh?

26
00:02:23,050 --> 00:02:24,010
What's wrong?

27
00:02:24,100 --> 00:02:25,390
It's moving.

28
00:02:25,640 --> 00:02:27,810
- Moving?
- How is that possible?

29
00:02:28,230 --> 00:02:30,890
Beats me. But judging
from the data,

30
00:02:30,980 --> 00:02:34,480
...it would mean that the recall
point itself is moving.

31
00:02:34,650 --> 00:02:36,650
Is that even possible?

32
00:02:36,730 --> 00:02:41,820
I haven't the slightest. It might mean
that this data isn't reliable.

33
00:02:42,410 --> 00:02:43,990
Damn thing is useless!

34
00:02:44,410 --> 00:02:46,620
Huh? What're you doing?

35
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:48,660
Point your face
somewhere else!

36
00:02:48,750 --> 00:02:51,830
Huh? What? I can't hear
a word you're saying!

37
00:02:51,920 --> 00:02:52,960
What's the matter?

38
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:55,000
Are you feeling ill?

39
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,420
It stinks!

40
00:02:59,550 --> 00:03:00,380
Stinks?

41
00:03:00,470 --> 00:03:02,380
What stinks?
Where?

42
00:03:03,010 --> 00:03:07,510
You guys reek to high heaven!

43
00:03:08,810 --> 00:03:12,940
Try brushing your teeth and washing up
every once in a while, damn it!

44
00:03:18,150 --> 00:03:19,570
It's some Gunmen!

45
00:03:26,450 --> 00:03:28,410
You out there in the Gunmen!

46
00:03:30,250 --> 00:03:33,210
Listen and be amazed!
Look and be amazed!

47
00:03:33,290 --> 00:03:37,380
My angry flames burn to ash any Gunmen
brazen enough to cross my path!

48
00:03:37,960 --> 00:03:44,800
You face the mighty Kamina, indomitable
leader of the invincible Team Gurren!

49
00:03:45,140 --> 00:03:48,600
Geez, can't he fight without
running his mouth off?

50
00:03:49,060 --> 00:03:53,100
Come at me
however you want!

51
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:56,100
They hardly put up
a fight at all!

52
00:03:56,190 --> 00:03:58,730
Is it just me, or are these
Gunmen getting weaker?

53
00:03:58,820 --> 00:03:59,940
Awesome! Awesome!

54
00:04:08,790 --> 00:04:12,620
I think it means that
we're getting tougher.

55
00:04:12,750 --> 00:04:14,330
Right, Simon?

56
00:04:14,420 --> 00:04:16,170
Y-You really think so?

57
00:04:16,250 --> 00:04:18,960
Wait a minute.
One of them is getting away.

58
00:04:19,050 --> 00:04:20,880
Yeah, let's kill 'em all!

59
00:04:21,010 --> 00:04:24,340
Kamina, do you suppose we might
arrive at the recall point...

60
00:04:24,430 --> 00:04:27,140
...if we follow that
fleeing Gunmen?

61
00:04:29,970 --> 00:04:31,390
That's it!

62
00:04:32,520 --> 00:04:36,100
Come back here, you long-eared
Gunmen varmint!

63
00:04:41,480 --> 00:04:44,030
Crap, where did it go?!

64
00:04:45,200 --> 00:04:46,910
It's hopeless in this fog.

65
00:04:47,030 --> 00:04:49,570
Hey! Bro!
Something's out there!

66
00:04:49,660 --> 00:04:50,830
A Gunmen?

67
00:04:50,910 --> 00:04:53,500
No, it's too small.

68
00:05:03,340 --> 00:05:06,430
What're you doing
out here, Gramps?

69
00:05:08,550 --> 00:05:10,350
Do you think he can
understand us?

70
00:05:10,470 --> 00:05:13,270
I wonder if there's a village
somewhere around here.

71
00:05:15,640 --> 00:05:17,310
You want us
to go that way?

72
00:05:23,610 --> 00:05:27,030
Hey, pops! What's out here
in the mountains?

73
00:05:27,110 --> 00:05:30,370
Huh? I can see something
up ahead, Bro.

74
00:05:45,010 --> 00:05:47,880
This building is blatantly suspicious.

75
00:05:47,970 --> 00:05:51,140
The air is warm.
And it's giving off steam.

76
00:05:51,550 --> 00:05:55,600
Everyone, we've delivered the old man
safely, so we should leave, and--

77
00:05:55,770 --> 00:05:57,520
You are going inside?

78
00:05:57,600 --> 00:06:00,270
Well, he seems to want us
to follow him!

79
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:03,480
Maybe he's gonna give us
a reward or something.

80
00:06:07,110 --> 00:06:09,530
Welcome!

81
00:06:10,280 --> 00:06:12,200
This is getting more
and more suspicious.

82
00:06:12,330 --> 00:06:15,040
Something fishy is going on!
Trust me!

83
00:06:17,040 --> 00:06:19,660
Well, well, if it isn't
the mighty Kamina.

84
00:06:20,040 --> 00:06:23,000
"How do you know who I am?"
you are about to ask?

85
00:06:24,460 --> 00:06:28,920
There isn't a single human on the surface
who hasn't heard of Team Gurren.

86
00:06:29,050 --> 00:06:29,930
Not a one!

87
00:06:30,050 --> 00:06:34,810
Your many exploits have given hope
and courage to villagers far and wide,

88
00:06:34,890 --> 00:06:36,770
...prompting them to take
to the surface themselves.

89
00:06:36,850 --> 00:06:39,430
You are the hero of the
entire human race!

90
00:06:39,560 --> 00:06:40,810
You're our hero!

91
00:06:40,900 --> 00:06:41,980
Moron.

92
00:06:42,060 --> 00:06:43,060
Gimmy, you too?

93
00:06:43,190 --> 00:06:46,440
You ladies and gentlemen
by the door, please, join us.

94
00:06:46,530 --> 00:06:49,400
Come in, come in!

95
00:06:53,530 --> 00:06:54,990
This is so fishy!

96
00:06:55,080 --> 00:06:57,870
It may look delicious in one sense,
but in another,

97
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:01,500
...it might contain poison so deadly
it can kill with a single--

98
00:07:01,870 --> 00:07:02,750
Hey, Rossiu!

99
00:07:02,830 --> 00:07:04,670
You've already eaten
9/10ths of it...

100
00:07:04,750 --> 00:07:08,760
Yeah, and if you don't hurry up,
I'm gonna eat the tenth that's left!

101
00:07:09,170 --> 00:07:11,050
A man's stomach knows no limits!

102
00:07:11,180 --> 00:07:13,430
Keep it coming!

103
00:07:13,720 --> 00:07:15,760
How manly!

104
00:07:23,900 --> 00:07:25,150
Is this safe?

105
00:07:25,980 --> 00:07:27,150
Oh, my!

106
00:07:27,610 --> 00:07:29,030
Kamina!

107
00:07:29,320 --> 00:07:30,610
I knew it, it's Kamina!

108
00:07:30,700 --> 00:07:31,950
- I missed you so!
- Um, who are you?

109
00:07:32,030 --> 00:07:35,780
Don't you remember? We're the three
sisters of the Black Siblings.

110
00:07:36,660 --> 00:07:37,950
Friends of yours?

111
00:07:38,040 --> 00:07:38,990
Yeah.

112
00:07:41,330 --> 00:07:45,210
Yoko, when did you
have kids?

113
00:07:46,590 --> 00:07:48,130
No way!
Did you and Kamina--

114
00:07:48,210 --> 00:07:49,590
As if!

115
00:07:49,760 --> 00:07:51,920
Come to think of it,
where's Kittan?

116
00:07:52,470 --> 00:07:57,010
He had some things to take care of.
We're on our own today.

117
00:07:58,100 --> 00:08:03,100
Actually, we were waiting for him near here,
but then some Gunmen showed up.

118
00:08:03,940 --> 00:08:07,560
Yes, that's right! And then while
we were chasing them,

119
00:08:07,650 --> 00:08:12,240
...this odd haze sprang up,
and just when we got lost--

120
00:08:12,570 --> 00:08:15,860
You were guided here by
a mysterious old man?

121
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:17,450
Right!

122
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:25,250
So... Who are you?

123
00:08:28,380 --> 00:08:30,750
Ladies and gentlemen,
once you have eaten your fill,

124
00:08:30,880 --> 00:08:35,180
...feel free to soak away your battle
fatigue in our prized hot spring.

125
00:08:35,430 --> 00:08:36,430
Hot spring?!

126
00:08:36,510 --> 00:08:39,260
Hot spring?
What the hell is that?

127
00:08:39,350 --> 00:08:42,060
You see, hon, a hot spring
is a place where--

128
00:08:47,190 --> 00:08:49,980
This is awesome...
Totally awesome!

129
00:08:50,070 --> 00:08:52,280
Take your time
and enjoy yourselves!

130
00:08:52,360 --> 00:08:55,450
- This hits the spot!
- This feels so wonderful!

131
00:09:00,540 --> 00:09:02,910
Bro, where are Rossiu and Ron?

132
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,960
Don't know, don't care.

133
00:09:12,510 --> 00:09:16,010
<font color=#FFC9B9>Gurren Lagann</font>

134
00:09:17,510 --> 00:09:21,010
<font color=#FFC9B9>Gurren Lagann</font>

135
00:09:28,440 --> 00:09:32,520
This hot spring is great...
Right, Bro?

136
00:09:33,230 --> 00:09:34,530
Hey, Simon?

137
00:09:34,610 --> 00:09:36,190
Yeah, what?

138
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:40,490
One of these days, you and me
need to try to go to the moon.

139
00:09:40,580 --> 00:09:42,280
Moon?
You mean this?

140
00:09:42,660 --> 00:09:44,540
No, THAT!

141
00:09:46,960 --> 00:09:49,250
I don't think any amount of wishful
thinking will make that happen.

142
00:09:49,330 --> 00:09:51,000
Moron!

143
00:09:54,260 --> 00:09:57,920
Reject common sense to make
the impossible possible!

144
00:09:58,340 --> 00:10:00,720
We made it up here
to the surface, didn't we?

145
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:03,470
It can't be impossible
to go to the moon!

146
00:10:06,930 --> 00:10:10,650
When you say it, I feel
like we really could.

147
00:10:17,780 --> 00:10:21,530
Come on, stop trying
to feel me up!

148
00:10:21,660 --> 00:10:24,700
Come on, Yoko, your breasts
look so touchable!

149
00:10:24,790 --> 00:10:25,660
Breasts?

150
00:10:25,750 --> 00:10:28,790
Mine are nowhere near
as big as Kiyoh's.

151
00:10:29,790 --> 00:10:31,710
But yours are
shaped better, Yoko.

152
00:10:31,790 --> 00:10:32,880
Shape?

153
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:37,460
I'm jealous of you two.
Mine are just like THIS.

154
00:10:37,550 --> 00:10:38,800
Like what?

155
00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:41,010
What about me?

156
00:10:41,300 --> 00:10:46,140
Don't worry, Darry. Yours will
get nice and bouncy soon.

157
00:10:46,220 --> 00:10:47,180
Bouncy?

158
00:10:47,310 --> 00:10:52,270
Yeah, they'll fill out, and they might get
so big and bouncy that they'll burst!

159
00:11:03,450 --> 00:11:06,200
W-We shouldn't
be doing this, Bro...

160
00:11:07,040 --> 00:11:11,460
Don't worry, I'll let you see 'em
after I'm done!

161
00:11:16,130 --> 00:11:18,210
See anything, Bro?

162
00:11:20,050 --> 00:11:22,260
Hey, Gimmy!
Find a hole!

163
00:11:22,390 --> 00:11:23,260
Hole?

164
00:11:23,590 --> 00:11:25,600
A hole! Look around
for a hole!

165
00:11:26,220 --> 00:11:28,430
Hole... Hole...
A hole?

166
00:11:28,770 --> 00:11:30,180
A hole!

167
00:11:30,810 --> 00:11:33,940
OW!

168
00:11:40,860 --> 00:11:42,070
Gimmy!

169
00:11:42,700 --> 00:11:43,950
Coming!

170
00:11:47,410 --> 00:11:48,990
Ouch...

171
00:11:49,540 --> 00:11:51,080
Did you see anything, Simon?

172
00:11:52,080 --> 00:11:53,250
See what?

173
00:11:53,330 --> 00:11:56,380
Quit screwing around!
You saw something, DIDN'T you?

174
00:11:56,460 --> 00:11:57,840
Well...

175
00:12:00,380 --> 00:12:02,380
I could see from the
shoulders up...

176
00:12:03,840 --> 00:12:06,340
C'mon, Gimmy!
Poke me in the butt!

177
00:12:06,680 --> 00:12:08,600
Huh? He's gone.

178
00:12:09,220 --> 00:12:10,470
It's so cute!

179
00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:14,390
Come on, let's get those
important bits washed!

180
00:12:14,810 --> 00:12:16,650
Feels so good...

181
00:12:16,770 --> 00:12:17,980
Simon! Your drill!

182
00:12:19,690 --> 00:12:22,150
I'm gonna drill this wall!
Drill it hard!

183
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:24,360
Please, let's just call it quits!

184
00:12:25,990 --> 00:12:28,660
Do you know what a man's path
is all about, Simon?

185
00:12:28,780 --> 00:12:31,490
It must have mountains,
valleys, and adventure!

186
00:12:31,580 --> 00:12:36,920
You've never seen REAL mountains, have you?
Not if you only saw from the shoulders up.

187
00:12:37,420 --> 00:12:39,750
Don't you want to see them?

188
00:12:39,840 --> 00:12:42,050
Those lovely peaks
and treacherous valleys?

189
00:12:43,510 --> 00:12:47,220
They're so big! And soft!
And they smell so nice!

190
00:12:47,430 --> 00:12:49,970
O-Oh, boy...
I sure do.

191
00:12:50,060 --> 00:12:53,770
Great! You handle this,
and I'll try another approach!

192
00:12:56,650 --> 00:12:59,020
No luck...
I can't see a thing.

193
00:12:59,230 --> 00:13:00,570
Drill, drill, drill...

194
00:13:00,690 --> 00:13:02,440
Drill, drill, drill...

195
00:13:02,530 --> 00:13:05,360
Bro! I'm through!

196
00:13:05,450 --> 00:13:09,950
Gross! I'm not the least bit
interested in Kamina!

197
00:13:10,030 --> 00:13:11,450
What, really?

198
00:13:11,660 --> 00:13:14,870
I might make a move
on him, then.

199
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:17,500
F-Feel free,
don't let me stop you!

200
00:13:17,580 --> 00:13:20,340
What about Simon, then?

201
00:13:20,590 --> 00:13:21,500
Pass.

202
00:13:22,300 --> 00:13:23,880
I know what you mean.

203
00:13:23,960 --> 00:13:26,670
Simon's still such a little kid.

204
00:13:26,760 --> 00:13:30,220
He's always latched onto Kamina.
He has no identity of his own.

205
00:13:30,300 --> 00:13:32,680
- He's so unreliable.
- And he's wishy-washy.

206
00:13:32,770 --> 00:13:33,890
He sure is!

207
00:13:35,890 --> 00:13:40,020
But if he worked at it a little harder,
he could become a good man.

208
00:13:40,150 --> 00:13:41,650
What makes you say that?

209
00:13:41,730 --> 00:13:46,740
He might be a mess most of the time,
but he comes through when it counts.

210
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:49,990
I guess I have a lot
of faith in him.

211
00:13:52,410 --> 00:13:55,080
Well, I'll be! There's something
going on here, all right!

212
00:13:55,120 --> 00:13:57,250
Cut it out!
It's not like that at--

213
00:13:59,580 --> 00:14:01,790
What's the deal?
Did you give up?

214
00:14:02,090 --> 00:14:03,340
Yep.

215
00:14:06,260 --> 00:14:07,760
This is fishy...

216
00:14:09,010 --> 00:14:10,550
Very fishy...

217
00:14:12,350 --> 00:14:14,390
Too suspicious by half...

218
00:14:21,610 --> 00:14:24,610
At long last...
Finally, I've made it!

219
00:14:25,110 --> 00:14:27,820
I have scaled these
lofty heights!

220
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:31,110
Ready or not, here I come
to where no man has gone--

221
00:14:48,590 --> 00:14:51,680
Damn it, I was so close...

222
00:14:52,760 --> 00:14:57,890
T-This bathhouse was a Gunmen?!

223
00:14:58,930 --> 00:15:02,560
Now, I believe it's time
to begin our human hunt!

224
00:15:02,860 --> 00:15:06,520
Hey, you're a Beastman! Coming out
at night is against the rules!

225
00:15:08,110 --> 00:15:10,900
Sorry, but my kind is nocturnal!

226
00:15:12,320 --> 00:15:15,950
This way! I set them up so they
could be used at a moment's notice!

227
00:15:16,540 --> 00:15:17,290
Thank you!

228
00:15:17,370 --> 00:15:18,580
So warm...

229
00:15:18,870 --> 00:15:20,040
Let's do it, Simon!

230
00:15:20,080 --> 00:15:20,660
Yeah!

231
00:15:20,750 --> 00:15:23,210
I think not!
Look at this!

232
00:15:23,580 --> 00:15:27,960
Damn it, Kamina, hurry up
and rescue us!

233
00:15:28,590 --> 00:15:29,800
She has Yoko and the girls!

234
00:15:29,880 --> 00:15:31,880
That's dirty!

235
00:15:31,970 --> 00:15:34,090
What's this stuff that
makes it so I can...

236
00:15:34,180 --> 00:15:36,220
...sorta make out what's
behind it, but not really?

237
00:15:37,850 --> 00:15:39,810
If you want me to remove
the mosaic filter,

238
00:15:39,890 --> 00:15:41,890
...step out of your Gunmen
this instant!

239
00:15:42,940 --> 00:15:44,270
What?!

240
00:15:44,560 --> 00:15:48,440
Is she kidding? Team Gurren
would never fall for that trick!

241
00:15:49,610 --> 00:15:52,570
Can you... remove those blocks?

242
00:15:52,780 --> 00:15:53,610
Bro?

243
00:15:53,740 --> 00:15:54,990
Forgive me.

244
00:15:59,660 --> 00:16:01,580
Okay, I'm out!

245
00:16:01,750 --> 00:16:04,170
Now, keep your end
of the deal!

246
00:16:04,500 --> 00:16:05,790
M-Moron!

247
00:16:06,840 --> 00:16:07,960
Very well.

248
00:16:13,260 --> 00:16:15,800
DON'T SCREW WITH ME!

249
00:16:15,930 --> 00:16:17,720
Let's combine, Simon!

250
00:16:18,430 --> 00:16:20,010
Bro, look!

251
00:16:21,230 --> 00:16:22,770
You Gurren-nappers!

252
00:16:23,100 --> 00:16:25,060
That was horrible...

253
00:16:25,150 --> 00:16:27,940
The whole bathhouse started
moving all of a sudden.

254
00:16:28,020 --> 00:16:30,690
Where in the world did Kamina
and the others get to?

255
00:16:35,240 --> 00:16:36,610
Why, this is Gurren!

256
00:16:38,990 --> 00:16:40,830
What're we gonna do, Bro?

257
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:42,870
- Save us, Kamina!
- Save us, Kamina!

258
00:16:43,410 --> 00:16:46,370
Right! Jump up and latch
onto its face, Simon!

259
00:16:48,340 --> 00:16:50,800
What were you thinking,
you pinhead?!

260
00:16:51,130 --> 00:16:53,010
It was obviously a trap!

261
00:16:53,130 --> 00:16:55,050
What kind of idiot would agree
to get out of his mecha for that?!

262
00:16:55,130 --> 00:16:57,970
Your brains must be rotted out,
you big pervert!

263
00:17:03,310 --> 00:17:05,690
I am so dead, Bro!

264
00:17:05,730 --> 00:17:06,770
Suck it up!

265
00:17:06,850 --> 00:17:08,560
Crap!

266
00:17:23,580 --> 00:17:26,160
Get outta my way, toadies!

267
00:17:37,380 --> 00:17:38,220
Wow! Kamina!

268
00:17:39,010 --> 00:17:41,390
You're safe!
Yoko!

269
00:17:47,060 --> 00:17:48,480
Kamina, you complete moron!

270
00:17:48,560 --> 00:17:50,900
How could you fall for
such a stupid stunt?!

271
00:17:51,110 --> 00:17:54,190
How are you supposed to fight
without Gurren?!

272
00:17:54,440 --> 00:17:55,780
I'm sorry!

273
00:17:57,110 --> 00:18:01,200
There are some things
I just have see!

274
00:18:02,740 --> 00:18:05,370
T-Then you should have
just said so!

275
00:18:05,500 --> 00:18:07,870
If you want to see them that badly,
I can show them to you any time!

276
00:18:12,920 --> 00:18:15,510
That didn't come out
the way I meant it!

277
00:18:15,630 --> 00:18:17,880
L-Look, we need to deal
with this Gunmen!

278
00:18:23,850 --> 00:18:25,180
You're history!

279
00:18:33,610 --> 00:18:34,610
What happened?!

280
00:18:34,690 --> 00:18:38,190
Engine room here! Those women
that escaped are--

281
00:18:39,150 --> 00:18:40,400
Damn them!

282
00:18:44,200 --> 00:18:45,620
Right! Ready to go?

283
00:18:45,700 --> 00:18:47,160
I think not!

284
00:18:47,250 --> 00:18:50,870
W-What?
What's going on?

285
00:18:52,250 --> 00:18:53,330
What the--?

286
00:18:54,590 --> 00:18:59,470
Stay right where you are.
If you try anything else,

287
00:19:00,800 --> 00:19:04,100
...I can easily crush
a few of their ribs.

288
00:19:05,220 --> 00:19:08,640
But you needn't worry.
I won't kill them.

289
00:19:08,930 --> 00:19:12,980
The women will all be sent to
the Spiral King as tributes!

290
00:19:14,610 --> 00:19:16,110
"Spiral King"?

291
00:19:16,190 --> 00:19:17,190
Indeed.

292
00:19:17,280 --> 00:19:22,320
The Spiral King is the mighty god of
this world who resides in the Capital!

293
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:28,740
Now I understand. He's the final boss...
Meaning he's the root of all evil.

294
00:19:30,160 --> 00:19:33,040
I won't stand for any insults
to the Spiral King.

295
00:19:33,250 --> 00:19:37,090
I see that you need to be
housebroken right away.

296
00:19:40,220 --> 00:19:42,800
Way to go, Gimmy!
Toss it to me!

297
00:19:43,550 --> 00:19:47,010
We have no need of men!
The next time you move, you die!

298
00:19:47,180 --> 00:19:49,220
Now, give that back!

299
00:19:49,640 --> 00:19:51,480
Gimmy, turn the dial!

300
00:19:54,520 --> 00:19:55,650
The other way!
The other way!

301
00:19:56,690 --> 00:19:57,610
Huh?

302
00:20:01,450 --> 00:20:02,570
Turn it some more!

303
00:20:02,650 --> 00:20:03,450
Give that back!

304
00:20:03,530 --> 00:20:05,070
What're you doing?!
Hurry! Turn it!

305
00:20:05,160 --> 00:20:06,490
Give that back!
Now!

306
00:20:06,580 --> 00:20:10,160
Prove that you're a man!
Turn it, turn it, turn it!

307
00:20:13,250 --> 00:20:14,420
Now!

308
00:20:16,340 --> 00:20:17,590
At long last!

309
00:20:19,420 --> 00:20:22,010
The moment has come!

310
00:20:24,680 --> 00:20:26,680
Wha--?
What the hell?

311
00:20:26,760 --> 00:20:29,390
They lent these to us, saying they
were for use in the outdoor bath.

312
00:20:29,470 --> 00:20:33,520
It's a special service for our customers!
Is there some sort of problem, sir?

313
00:20:35,900 --> 00:20:37,900
A problem? Do I have
a problem?!

314
00:20:37,980 --> 00:20:41,650
You took the heights of the
human spirit, of the male soul,

315
00:20:41,740 --> 00:20:44,860
...and you stomped it into the dirt,
smacked it around, and smashed it!

316
00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:48,370
I'll follow all of you bastards down
to the deepest pits of hell...

317
00:20:48,490 --> 00:20:51,040
...and kill you a million
times over!

318
00:20:51,120 --> 00:20:53,000
Simon!

319
00:20:53,120 --> 00:20:54,210
Bro!

320
00:20:54,670 --> 00:20:56,210
Pile in, everybody!

321
00:20:56,290 --> 00:20:58,630
- We can't all fit!
- I'm falling out!

322
00:20:58,710 --> 00:21:01,170
Close the canopy,
and we'll fit!

323
00:21:01,670 --> 00:21:02,840
It's so cramped...

324
00:21:03,130 --> 00:21:05,130
Won't this make it
too heavy to move?

325
00:21:05,260 --> 00:21:06,630
No, it'll work!

326
00:21:11,970 --> 00:21:13,770
Look! It's Gurren!

327
00:21:14,350 --> 00:21:17,520
Just like you said, Kamina, I was able
to power it with fighting spirit.

328
00:21:17,850 --> 00:21:19,650
Way to go, Forehead Boy!

329
00:21:19,730 --> 00:21:22,730
Okay, let's combine!

330
00:21:24,900 --> 00:21:26,110
Um, shall I get out?

331
00:21:26,200 --> 00:21:27,820
There's no time!

332
00:21:30,740 --> 00:21:32,370
Man's Wrath...

333
00:21:32,450 --> 00:21:33,240
What?!

334
00:21:33,330 --> 00:21:36,080
...Explosive Slash!

335
00:21:40,750 --> 00:21:43,420
We did it! We did it!
We did it!

336
00:21:46,050 --> 00:21:48,180
Good mornin', sunshine...

337
00:22:07,650 --> 00:22:09,030
W-What was that?!

338
00:22:24,550 --> 00:22:28,170
It's been a long time, naked ape!

339
00:22:28,800 --> 00:22:31,010
Um, who's this guy again?

340
00:22:31,050 --> 00:22:35,060
To Be Continued...

</font>I don't want to listen to that crap

343
00:23:00,930 --> 00:23:06,990
<font color=#FFFF00>Taiyou motomete kage ha tamashii no nuketa koe kara
</font>'Cuz they seek the sun, the shadows suddenly change from

344
00:23:06,990 --> 00:23:12,870
<font color=#FFFF00>Kyuu ni surudoi kuchou ni kawaru
</font>The soul's missing voice to a sharp tone of voice

345
00:23:13,030 --> 00:23:19,580
<font color=#FFFF00>Sono oto ga machi no naka ni kodama-shite hibikinagara
</font>While that sound echoed and bounced in the middle of town,

346
00:23:19,580 --> 00:23:25,620
<font color=#FFFF00>Kemono no you na koe de sakebitsudzuketa
</font>I kept on screaming in a beastly voice

347
00:23:25,660 --> 00:23:28,890
<font color=#FFFF00>Kidou wo kaeta tsumori ha nai
</font>No way I'm going to change my course

348
00:23:28,890 --> 00:23:32,090
<font color=#FFFF00>Zankyou ha giratsuiteru ga
</font>The reverb's dazzling, but

349
00:23:32,090 --> 00:23:35,130
<font color=#FFFF00>Kussetsu-shite hanarete iku
</font>It refracts and comes apart

350
00:23:35,130 --> 00:23:39,260
<font color=#FFFF00>Koko no sekai ha itsumo kou da
</font>The world right here is always like this

351
00:23:46,180 --> 00:23:52,700
<font color=#FFFF00>Soto no sekai ni ha hikari ha aru no ka
</font>Is there light in the world outside?

352
00:24:05,560 --> 00:24:08,570
<b>Next Time</b>

353
00:24:06,650 --> 00:24:08,570
There are times when a man's gotta do
what a man's gotta do.

354
00:24:08,900 --> 00:24:10,990
Sometime, somewhere,
maybe here, maybe there,

355
00:24:11,110 --> 00:24:12,820
...you might come across
a golden opportunity.

356
00:24:12,900 --> 00:24:14,860
Whether you live or die
is up to your ability!

357
00:24:14,910 --> 00:24:20,580
<b>You're Gonna Do It!</b>

358
00:24:14,910 --> 00:24:19,580
Next time on Gurren Lagann,
"You're Gonna Do It!"
