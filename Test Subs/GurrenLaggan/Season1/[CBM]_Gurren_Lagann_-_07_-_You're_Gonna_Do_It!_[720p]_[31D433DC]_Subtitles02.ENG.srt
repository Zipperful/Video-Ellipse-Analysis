1
00:00:10,670 --> 00:00:15,510
Gurren Lagann

2
00:00:15,580 --> 00:00:18,110
<font color=#FFFF00>Kimi ha kikoeru?
</font>Can you hear it?

3
00:00:18,250 --> 00:00:26,250
<font color=#FFFF00>Boku no kono koe ga yami ni munashiku suikomareta
</font>This voice of mine was sucked emptily into darkness

4
00:00:26,600 --> 00:00:31,700
<font color=#FFFF00>Moshimo sekai ga imi wo motsu no nara
</font>If the world has meaning to it,

5
00:00:32,030 --> 00:00:36,570
<font color=#FFFF00>Konna kimochi mo muda de ha nai
</font>Then these kinds of feelings aren't futile

6
00:00:36,910 --> 00:00:42,610
<font color=#FFFF00>Akogare ni oshitsubusarete akirametetanda
</font>I was crushed by my longing and had given up

7
00:00:42,910 --> 00:00:47,870
<font color=#FFFF00>Hateshinai sora no iro mo shiranaide
</font>Without even knowing the color of the endless sky

8
00:00:48,280 --> 00:00:53,190
<font color=#FFFF00>Hashiridashita omoi ga ima demo
</font>I began to run, because my feelings, even now,

9
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:58,960
<font color=#FFFF00>Kono mune wo tashika ni tataiteru kara
</font>Are definitely beating against my heart

10
00:00:59,230 --> 00:01:04,030
<font color=#FFFF00>Kyou no boku ga sono saki ni tsudzuku
</font>The me of today will continue towards our destination

11
00:01:04,500 --> 00:01:10,060
<font color=#FFFF00>Bokura nari no asu wo kizuite yuku
</font>We'll amass our own tomorrows

12
00:01:10,410 --> 00:01:18,900
<font color=#FFFF00>Kotae ha sou itsumo koko ni aru
</font>The answer, yes, is always right here

13
00:01:32,170 --> 00:01:37,220
This is the story of a man who has yet
to realize what his destiny is.

14
00:01:37,470 --> 00:01:40,340
Days of constant fighting continue
as they search for the enemy base.

15
00:01:40,890 --> 00:01:43,510
Just when they thought that a new
journey was about to begin...

16
00:01:43,890 --> 00:01:46,930
...after they foiled the underhanded
trap set by the bathhouse Gunmen,

17
00:01:47,020 --> 00:01:49,390
...an enormous figure
suddenly appeared.

18
00:01:49,480 --> 00:01:53,020
This was the beginning
of a new set of trials.

19
00:01:56,780 --> 00:01:59,320
It's been a long time, hasn't it,
you naked ape?!

20
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:01,780
Wait, you're--

21
00:02:02,370 --> 00:02:06,870
I see that you've had your fun lately,
but that is at an end today.

22
00:02:07,580 --> 00:02:10,170
I've come to settle this
once and for all!

23
00:02:10,250 --> 00:02:11,330
Viral!

24
00:02:11,460 --> 00:02:15,590
Now... You will return
my helmet to me!

25
00:02:16,420 --> 00:02:21,390
Or so I'd like to say...
But first things first.

26
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:25,310
Put some clothes on!

27
00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:34,400
Episode 7:
You're Gonna Do It!

28
00:02:44,950 --> 00:02:49,330
You're being awfully understanding,
giving us time to get dressed like this!

29
00:02:50,250 --> 00:02:54,670
Defeating a NAKED naked ape
will win me no honors.

30
00:02:54,880 --> 00:02:58,760
Warriors of the Capital
prize decorum above all else!

31
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:01,840
The Capital?

32
00:03:01,930 --> 00:03:04,640
That must be their base, Bro!

33
00:03:05,220 --> 00:03:08,600
Our "base"? It is nothing
so unimportant as a mere base!

34
00:03:13,730 --> 00:03:16,770
The Capital is unique,
and it is eternal!

35
00:03:16,940 --> 00:03:22,490
It is the sole example of civilization on
the surface, ruled by the Spiral King!

36
00:03:22,570 --> 00:03:23,740
Spiral King?

37
00:03:23,820 --> 00:03:25,070
Civilization, huh?

38
00:03:33,540 --> 00:03:38,090
Damn you, return my helmet
this instant!

39
00:03:38,800 --> 00:03:43,220
After all that speechifying,
THAT'S all you want?!

40
00:03:51,850 --> 00:03:55,730
You seem determined to utterly and
completely make an enemy of the Capital.

41
00:03:55,980 --> 00:04:00,940
Very well, learn now the
power of the Capital!

42
00:04:18,130 --> 00:04:18,710
A mountain?

43
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:23,010
A mountain? Since when do
mountains shoot at you?!

44
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:24,630
It's moving!

45
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:26,260
What?!

46
00:04:37,980 --> 00:04:41,900
Who is that?!
What has this kind of firepower?

47
00:04:43,190 --> 00:04:46,910
Do you now know the power
of the Capital?

48
00:04:47,820 --> 00:04:48,950
Yikes.

49
00:04:50,990 --> 00:04:53,120
Surrender and return
my helmet to me!

50
00:04:53,200 --> 00:04:57,580
No, YOU give up and be happy
with that freaky bird crest doohickey!

51
00:04:57,880 --> 00:05:00,250
That's enough of your impudence.

52
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:21,270
It's huge!

53
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:22,360
Enormous!

54
00:05:22,480 --> 00:05:24,230
- Incredible...
- Massive!

55
00:05:24,280 --> 00:05:25,570
It's so gigantic!

56
00:05:25,700 --> 00:05:27,530
Goodness, I'm blushing...

57
00:05:28,870 --> 00:05:33,790
Do you see? This is Dai-Gunzan,
the mobile fortress Gunmen!

58
00:05:34,370 --> 00:05:36,660
Bro, that thing is
way too big for us.

59
00:05:37,830 --> 00:05:38,750
This oughta be good.

60
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:42,790
This isn't good. This is the point!
It's the recall point!

61
00:05:43,250 --> 00:05:47,630
It overlaps perfectly with the Gunmen
point of origin we've been searching for!

62
00:05:47,720 --> 00:05:51,180
It makes sense that
their base is mobile.

63
00:05:51,390 --> 00:05:53,390
It's a Gunmen, too!

64
00:05:56,100 --> 00:05:59,190
You seem to be having
some trouble, Viral.

65
00:05:59,350 --> 00:06:01,560
Sir. My apologies, sir.

66
00:06:01,650 --> 00:06:03,730
There's a Beastman piloting
that one, too?

67
00:06:05,150 --> 00:06:07,440
Kamina! Get back!
It's too dangerous!

68
00:06:07,780 --> 00:06:10,530
That guy seems to be
the Gunmen's boss!

69
00:06:11,200 --> 00:06:12,950
This looks like it'll be fun.

70
00:06:14,540 --> 00:06:18,910
Nobody's cast such a big
shadow over me before.

71
00:06:19,420 --> 00:06:24,210
Don't think you're going home
unscathed, buddy!

72
00:06:24,550 --> 00:06:27,760
Look, Bro, maybe we're the
ones who should be leaving.

73
00:06:27,880 --> 00:06:30,970
W-We're no match for
something this big!

74
00:06:31,590 --> 00:06:33,930
We're gonna knock him on his ass
BECAUSE he's big!

75
00:06:34,350 --> 00:06:36,430
What's the matter?
Lost your nerve?

76
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:38,180
Butt out, cannon fodder!

77
00:06:38,890 --> 00:06:42,520
You puny humans have gotten
too big for your britches.

78
00:06:42,610 --> 00:06:44,650
You have incurred the wrath
of the Spiral King.

79
00:06:45,690 --> 00:06:49,780
I, one of the Spiral King's Four Generals,
have come to put you in your place!

80
00:06:49,900 --> 00:06:51,740
I see you up there!

81
00:06:58,250 --> 00:06:59,370
- Kamina!
- Kamina!

82
00:06:59,460 --> 00:07:00,660
Kamina!

83
00:07:03,460 --> 00:07:04,380
We're getting out of here!
Hurry!

84
00:07:04,460 --> 00:07:06,290
- Son of a bitch!
- Hey!

85
00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:10,800
Did you see that, human?

86
00:07:13,850 --> 00:07:18,100
You can try to steal as many
Gunmen from us as you want,

87
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:24,020
...but they are ineffective before
the might of my Dai-Gunzan!

88
00:07:24,520 --> 00:07:25,860
Kamina!

89
00:07:26,980 --> 00:07:31,360
Who's the ineffective one here?
That didn't hurt, it didn't even tingle.

90
00:07:32,610 --> 00:07:35,490
Don't mess with Gurren Lagann!

91
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:38,620
It's no use, our left leg
is damaged!

92
00:07:39,040 --> 00:07:40,870
What's the matter, have you
run out of fight already?

93
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:45,080
Would you give it a rest already?!
There's a time to give up, and this is it!

94
00:07:45,170 --> 00:07:49,210
Kamina, I suggest we withdraw for now
and formulate a proper strategy!

95
00:07:49,510 --> 00:07:52,050
I think we're in
big trouble this time.

96
00:07:52,180 --> 00:07:53,930
Are you kidding me?!

97
00:07:55,010 --> 00:07:57,640
Never retreat, never surrender,
never look back!

98
00:07:57,720 --> 00:08:00,680
That's how me and Simon
see the world!

99
00:08:00,980 --> 00:08:01,680
Kamina!

100
00:08:01,810 --> 00:08:04,020
No more talk!

101
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:09,860
What is this,
a guy never says die?

102
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:21,120
Huh? It's... It's fixed!

103
00:08:21,200 --> 00:08:22,580
Fighting spirit!

104
00:08:23,330 --> 00:08:25,830
You never get anywhere
by running away!

105
00:08:25,920 --> 00:08:28,210
Fine! See if I care!
You blockhead!

106
00:08:28,290 --> 00:08:30,550
Who asked you!
Get back!

107
00:08:31,090 --> 00:08:32,340
Look out! Look out!

108
00:08:33,550 --> 00:08:36,970
Damn it! Isn't there any way
we can get on top of this thing?!

109
00:08:37,970 --> 00:08:40,140
There's just too much cannon fire!
It's hopeless!

110
00:08:40,220 --> 00:08:41,430
All right, then...

111
00:08:42,730 --> 00:08:46,140
What's the matter? Have you
finally given up, human?

112
00:08:57,740 --> 00:09:00,910
For humans, your tenacity
was admirable.

113
00:09:00,990 --> 00:09:03,620
Your resistance was brave,
but doomed to fail.

114
00:09:03,750 --> 00:09:10,000
Dai-Gunzan's concentrated cannon
fire will smash you to charred scrap!

115
00:09:14,300 --> 00:09:15,470
Impossible!

116
00:09:15,550 --> 00:09:17,680
Fire! Fire!
Fire!

117
00:09:25,890 --> 00:09:33,900
Man on Fire!
Blazing Chariot Kick!

118
00:09:41,240 --> 00:09:43,830
Something doesn't
seem right over there.

119
00:09:44,870 --> 00:09:46,790
Did Kamina die?

120
00:09:47,620 --> 00:09:48,750
I don't know.

121
00:09:48,830 --> 00:09:50,920
No way would Kamina buy it!

122
00:09:51,040 --> 00:09:54,130
But there was that
huge explosion...

123
00:09:56,800 --> 00:09:57,470
Something's coming!

124
00:09:57,590 --> 00:09:58,880
What is?

125
00:10:03,470 --> 00:10:05,430
G-Gunmen!

126
00:10:05,560 --> 00:10:07,020
Run away!

127
00:10:08,270 --> 00:10:11,150
I won't let a single one of
you filthy humans escape me.

128
00:10:11,270 --> 00:10:12,650
General Thymilph!

129
00:10:13,480 --> 00:10:15,610
Look at the Gunmen
on our deck!

130
00:10:15,690 --> 00:10:17,030
Viral's status?

131
00:10:17,110 --> 00:10:18,280
Unconscious!

132
00:10:18,990 --> 00:10:20,610
Worthless!

133
00:10:23,410 --> 00:10:24,990
If only I had my rifle!

134
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,700
We're surrounded!

135
00:10:47,270 --> 00:10:49,640
Amazing! It took out
three of them at once!

136
00:10:49,730 --> 00:10:51,560
It doesn't seem to
be an enemy...

137
00:10:51,690 --> 00:10:54,560
The gold plating on that Gunmen
looks rather haphazard.

138
00:10:55,610 --> 00:10:59,780
If you're not an enemy, go to Kamina!
Save him! Help us!

139
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:05,240
What's that bozo Kamina
gotten himself into now?

140
00:11:11,500 --> 00:11:15,000
<font color=#FFC9B9>Gurren Lagann</font>

141
00:11:16,500 --> 00:11:20,010
<font color=#FFC9B9>Gurren Lagann</font>

142
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:31,770
Now, then...
You're the head honcho, huh?

143
00:11:32,980 --> 00:11:35,110
So, I finally get to
see your face!

144
00:11:35,190 --> 00:11:38,400
I am one of the Spiral King's
Four Generals...

145
00:11:39,240 --> 00:11:41,440
...Thymilph, the Raging Wave.

146
00:11:42,570 --> 00:11:46,910
Yeah, whatever! Dig the wax
outta your ears and listen up!

147
00:11:47,330 --> 00:11:51,620
He takes the blazing sun in his
bare hands and endures the heat!

148
00:11:51,910 --> 00:11:54,460
He's a man's man who is sustained
by strength of will!

149
00:11:54,580 --> 00:11:57,380
When you hear of the great Kamina,
they're talkin' about ME!

150
00:11:58,590 --> 00:12:00,800
You'd best remember it!

151
00:12:01,920 --> 00:12:03,430
I'm really scared here, Bro...

152
00:12:03,880 --> 00:12:08,720
Relax, Simon! As long as we stay
up here, they won't risk shooting!

153
00:12:10,600 --> 00:12:12,600
Are you sure about that?

154
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:31,870
I won't tolerate your big mouth,
not here atop my own Dai-Gunzan!

155
00:12:32,080 --> 00:12:35,960
When it comes to big mouths,
Dai-Gunzan's is by far the biggest! Splat!

156
00:12:39,300 --> 00:12:41,090
I'll tear you limb from limb!

157
00:12:46,640 --> 00:12:48,720
W-We're coming apart!

158
00:12:51,310 --> 00:12:53,310
It's about to tear!

159
00:12:55,940 --> 00:12:57,770
Rip apart!

160
00:13:02,820 --> 00:13:04,110
Split asunder!

161
00:13:09,990 --> 00:13:11,530
Ow!

162
00:13:12,500 --> 00:13:13,410
Who's there?

163
00:13:13,500 --> 00:13:17,250
General Thymilph! Over there!
A Gunmen!

164
00:13:17,710 --> 00:13:19,670
A Gunmen saved us?

165
00:13:20,340 --> 00:13:22,920
- Get clear while we keep them busy!
- I know that voice!

166
00:13:23,010 --> 00:13:25,470
That's right, it's Dayakka
from Littner!

167
00:13:26,840 --> 00:13:29,430
Kittan of the Black Siblings
is here, too!

168
00:13:29,760 --> 00:13:31,680
Sorry to keep you waiting, Kamina!

169
00:13:33,560 --> 00:13:34,640
Who are you?

170
00:13:34,730 --> 00:13:38,140
It's me! Kittan!
Did you forget already?!

171
00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:40,360
What the hell are you guys
doing with Gunmen?

172
00:13:40,440 --> 00:13:41,690
Because of you.

173
00:13:41,820 --> 00:13:42,860
Me?

174
00:13:42,980 --> 00:13:46,240
You got your hands on Gurren,
so now everybody is copying you.

175
00:13:46,360 --> 00:13:48,200
I'm not copying anybody!

176
00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:49,070
"Everybody"?

177
00:13:49,160 --> 00:13:52,950
That's right. From what I hear,
more of our friends will be here soon.

178
00:13:53,370 --> 00:13:54,410
Our friends?

179
00:13:55,660 --> 00:13:59,580
Filthy humans...
Scheming vermin!

180
00:13:59,830 --> 00:14:01,460
Shoot! Shoot them!

181
00:14:01,710 --> 00:14:03,550
Attack!

182
00:14:05,300 --> 00:14:09,630
Geez, nothing but cannon fodder again.
I wish they'd send some--

183
00:14:10,680 --> 00:14:13,890
This is bad! They're ganging up
on Kamina and Simon!

184
00:14:14,060 --> 00:14:17,230
Um, hello? Kamina?
Do you read me?

185
00:14:17,310 --> 00:14:19,310
The shape it's in now, you don't have
a chance of winning in Gurren Lagann!

186
00:14:19,480 --> 00:14:24,150
If you're defeated now, who's
going to lead our new allies?

187
00:14:24,400 --> 00:14:28,110
If you die here,
who's going to lead us?!

188
00:14:28,240 --> 00:14:29,400
Get off my case!

189
00:14:29,660 --> 00:14:32,030
Like I said, you'll never get
anywhere by running away!

190
00:14:37,660 --> 00:14:38,370
Bro!

191
00:14:38,540 --> 00:14:39,370
Yeah, what?!

192
00:14:39,460 --> 00:14:41,790
Yoko's right! Let's retreat
just this once!

193
00:14:41,880 --> 00:14:43,960
What the hell? Have you
lost your nerve?

194
00:14:44,040 --> 00:14:45,460
Yes! My nerve is done and gone!

195
00:14:45,550 --> 00:14:46,420
Chicken!

196
00:14:46,510 --> 00:14:49,840
If means getting you home in one piece,
I'll lose my nerve if that's what it takes!

197
00:14:50,260 --> 00:14:52,510
I mean, everyone's waiting for you!

198
00:14:54,010 --> 00:14:55,220
Bro!

199
00:14:56,770 --> 00:14:58,060
We can't.

200
00:15:02,060 --> 00:15:05,730
Take a look, Simon. If we turn our back
on these guys, we'll be sitting ducks.

201
00:15:06,110 --> 00:15:12,110
Either way, unless we pin this thing down,
we don't have a hope of winning our fight!

202
00:15:12,280 --> 00:15:14,030
That's true, but how do we--

203
00:15:21,620 --> 00:15:23,460
Bro! I have an idea!

204
00:15:23,580 --> 00:15:24,210
Say what?

205
00:15:24,670 --> 00:15:26,170
Let me handle this!

206
00:15:34,890 --> 00:15:38,560
All right.
I'll leave this fight to you.

207
00:15:42,100 --> 00:15:44,560
You won't escape!

208
00:15:47,650 --> 00:15:50,360
What the hell?
What's he trying to do?

209
00:16:11,170 --> 00:16:13,010
There's nowhere left to run!

210
00:16:13,090 --> 00:16:14,720
Their back is to a cliff...

211
00:16:14,840 --> 00:16:18,810
Were those kids really
that foolish?

212
00:16:32,740 --> 00:16:34,150
It's all over!

213
00:16:35,740 --> 00:16:37,280
Yeah, for you!

214
00:16:38,240 --> 00:16:39,830
What?!

215
00:16:45,370 --> 00:16:48,420
Stinking humans...
What are you up to?

216
00:16:49,420 --> 00:16:53,260
I'll crush you underfoot!

217
00:17:10,940 --> 00:17:12,820
Kamina, you bastard!

218
00:17:12,900 --> 00:17:14,780
Hey, don't look at me, pal.

219
00:17:15,360 --> 00:17:18,280
Mark my words, naked ape!
Don't think this means you've won!

220
00:17:18,910 --> 00:17:22,580
Dai-Gunzan is the merest fraction
of the Capital's military might!

221
00:17:22,700 --> 00:17:26,080
And you have just made an enemy
of that might!

222
00:17:26,290 --> 00:17:29,040
Mark my words! We will
be back tomorrow!

223
00:17:29,500 --> 00:17:31,790
Say your prayers!

224
00:17:36,590 --> 00:17:39,970
That's our Simon the Digger!
Way to go!

225
00:17:51,020 --> 00:17:52,070
Bro!

226
00:17:52,150 --> 00:17:53,400
Whaddya think?

227
00:17:53,480 --> 00:17:56,650
This is a bunch of people from all over
who have been resisting the Gunmen!

228
00:17:56,780 --> 00:18:00,660
They heard rumors about a couple morons
fighting in a stolen Gunmen,

229
00:18:00,780 --> 00:18:03,330
...and they gathered together
to join the fight!

230
00:18:04,660 --> 00:18:07,750
We all caught your stupidity bug.

231
00:18:19,260 --> 00:18:21,220
Fighting spirit repaired
the armor, did it?

232
00:18:21,350 --> 00:18:24,310
Yeah, but it disappeared as soon
as I separated from Lagann.

233
00:18:24,810 --> 00:18:26,350
I thought as much.

234
00:18:27,140 --> 00:18:30,100
Come to think of it, what did you do with
your village's women and children?

235
00:18:30,230 --> 00:18:32,360
Oh, them. We left them
in the care of Giha Village.

236
00:18:32,480 --> 00:18:34,070
I'm surprised
our chief agreed.

237
00:18:34,150 --> 00:18:39,200
Gurren Lagann is a symbol of hope
for humanity, more so than you know.

238
00:18:39,490 --> 00:18:41,320
Still, you should be careful.

239
00:18:41,410 --> 00:18:45,370
Good intentions can sometimes tempt
people down the wrong path.

240
00:18:45,490 --> 00:18:46,790
Just as it did in my village.

241
00:18:46,830 --> 00:18:48,200
Forehead Boy!

242
00:18:48,580 --> 00:18:51,670
There you go again,
talking like you know it all!

243
00:18:51,710 --> 00:18:53,080
Smarty-pants.

244
00:18:53,960 --> 00:18:55,130
I'm Zorthy.

245
00:18:55,550 --> 00:18:56,340
I'm Kid.

246
00:18:56,670 --> 00:18:58,010
Me, I'm Iraak.

247
00:18:58,380 --> 00:19:00,090
I'm J-J-Jorgun.

248
00:19:00,300 --> 00:19:01,880
I'm B-B-Balinbow.

249
00:19:02,890 --> 00:19:05,350
Okay, fine, whatever.
Nice to meet you.

250
00:19:05,810 --> 00:19:06,850
But for now...

251
00:19:06,890 --> 00:19:10,140
Okay, you bozos!
I'm glad you could make it!

252
00:19:11,190 --> 00:19:13,690
About that huge Gunmen
from this afternoon...

253
00:19:13,810 --> 00:19:16,320
You can be sure that it'll
come back tomorrow!

254
00:19:17,940 --> 00:19:22,950
In which case... I say we steal
that big-ass Gunmen from them!

255
00:19:24,450 --> 00:19:26,530
We're gonna help ourselves to it!

256
00:19:26,620 --> 00:19:29,750
And after tomorrow, it's gonna
be our headquarters!

257
00:19:29,870 --> 00:19:31,500
Pretty sweet, huh?!

258
00:19:34,250 --> 00:19:37,090
We've come this far by stealing
Gunmen from the Beastmen!

259
00:19:37,170 --> 00:19:39,170
There's nothing to be afraid of!

260
00:19:40,760 --> 00:19:42,680
Yeah, but how are we
gonna do that, Bro?

261
00:19:42,760 --> 00:19:45,930
That's easy!
YOU'RE gonna do it.

262
00:19:46,180 --> 00:19:48,060
Huh? M-Me?!

263
00:19:52,730 --> 00:19:55,230
Listen, when Gurren Lagann combines,

264
00:19:55,310 --> 00:19:58,770
...it's accomplished by Lagann
taking over Gurren's systems.

265
00:19:59,190 --> 00:20:01,360
That's Gurren Lagann's strength.

266
00:20:01,450 --> 00:20:04,820
That means that if Lagann
can combine with Dai-Gunzan,

267
00:20:04,910 --> 00:20:06,780
...it will be able to take over
its systems.

268
00:20:06,910 --> 00:20:07,870
It'll be okay.

269
00:20:07,950 --> 00:20:09,290
You can do it, Simon.
Lagann's power is also linked to Simon's mental energy.

270
00:20:09,290 --> 00:20:12,000
Lagann's power is also linked to Simon's mental energy.

271
00:20:12,080 --> 00:20:15,790
Depending on your spirit, it--
Are you paying attention, Simon?

272
00:20:19,380 --> 00:20:21,090
What a beautiful moon.

273
00:20:21,220 --> 00:20:25,220
Just being able to see this
makes me glad I came up to the surface.

274
00:20:31,100 --> 00:20:36,190
We have to win. We can't afford
to be slowed down, not now.

275
00:20:36,270 --> 00:20:39,230
We'll keep stealing and stealing
and stealing their weapons.

276
00:20:39,320 --> 00:20:43,280
We have to keep winning until they
give up on the idea of attacking us.

277
00:20:44,450 --> 00:20:49,120
And besides, I wanna give Simon and
Forehead Boy and Gimmy and Darry...

278
00:20:49,410 --> 00:20:53,830
...a world where kids can look up at
the sun without a care in the world.

279
00:20:54,120 --> 00:20:55,210
Kamina.

280
00:20:55,290 --> 00:20:56,620
Yeah, what?

281
00:20:56,750 --> 00:20:58,960
You have more brains than
I gave you credit for.

282
00:20:59,040 --> 00:21:01,210
Who the hell do you
think I am?

283
00:21:01,380 --> 00:21:05,720
Kamina! Badass leader of the
indomitable Team Gurren, that's who.

284
00:21:05,800 --> 00:21:07,300
You're wrong.

285
00:21:07,720 --> 00:21:12,810
We're not Team Gurren.
We're now Team DAI-Gurren!

286
00:21:16,350 --> 00:21:19,730
Even so, I don't want you to do
anything crazy like you did today.

287
00:21:20,980 --> 00:21:24,690
Up until now, there was always
a method to your madness.

288
00:21:25,030 --> 00:21:27,740
I could always tell myself,
"If anybody can pull it off, it's Kamina."

289
00:21:28,700 --> 00:21:30,660
But this afternoon was different.

290
00:21:30,740 --> 00:21:34,120
That wasn't reckless or even crazy.
That was plain stupid!

291
00:21:34,910 --> 00:21:37,160
You rushed in there
without thinking it through,

292
00:21:37,290 --> 00:21:40,920
...and if Simon hadn't been there,
you might have been killed.

293
00:21:43,210 --> 00:21:46,880
I... I guess that frightened me.

294
00:21:52,220 --> 00:21:53,600
Kamina.

295
00:22:07,740 --> 00:22:09,700
Simon! Don't be scared!

296
00:22:09,820 --> 00:22:11,660
Simon, if anybody can
do it, it's you!

297
00:22:13,620 --> 00:22:15,540
Yeah, I guess you're right.

298
00:22:19,120 --> 00:22:20,880
Flames are coming from
that mountain!

299
00:22:21,460 --> 00:22:24,130
The mountain is belching up fire
and setting the earth ablaze...

300
00:22:24,630 --> 00:22:29,010
Talk about a fitting setting for
a once-in-a-lifetime fight!

301
00:22:29,090 --> 00:22:30,930
Now I'm psyched!

302
00:22:31,010 --> 00:22:35,010
To Be Continued...

303
00:22:42,250 --> 00:22:48,480
<font color=#FFFF00>Hikari wo motomete kage ha tawainai jooku wo shaberu

<font color=#FFFF00>Kikitai no ha sonna koto ja nai

00:23:00,930 --> 00:23:06,990
<font color=#FFFF00>Taiyou motomete kage ha tamashii no nuketa koe kara

<font color=#FFFF00>Kyuu ni surudoi kuchou ni kawaru
</font>The soul's missing voice to a sharp tone of voice

00:23:13,030 --> 00:23:19,580
<font color=#FFFF00>Sono oto ga machi no naka ni kodama-shite hibikinagara
</font>While that sound echoed and bounced in the middle of town,

308
00:23:19,580 --> 00:23:25,620
<font color=#FFFF00>Kemono no you na koe de sakebitsudzuketa
</font>I kept on screaming in a beastly voice

309
00:23:25,660 --> 00:23:28,890
<font color=#FFFF00>Kidou wo kaeta tsumori ha nai
</font>No way I'm going to change my course

310
00:23:28,890 --> 00:23:32,090

</font>The reverb's dazzling, but

311
00:23:32,090 --> 00:23:35,130
<font color=#FFFF00>Kussetsu-shite hanarete iku
</font>It refracts and comes apart

313
00:23:46,180 --> 00:23:52,700
<font color=#FFFF00>Soto no sekai ni ha hikari ha aru no ka
</font>Is there light in the world outside?

314
00:24:05,520 --> 00:24:08,520
<b>Next Time</b>

315
00:24:06,480 --> 00:24:09,190
Listen, Simon.
Never forget this.

316
00:24:09,280 --> 00:24:13,280
Believe in yourself. Not in the
Simon that I have faith in.

317
00:24:13,410 --> 00:24:15,820
Not in the Kamina that
you believe in, either.

318
00:24:16,030 --> 00:24:20,540
<b>Later, Buddy</b>

319
00:24:16,030 --> 00:24:19,540
Believe in the Simon
who believes in you!
