1
00:00:05,880 --> 00:00:08,750
Your actions are baffling, Irregular.

2
00:00:09,170 --> 00:00:11,840
Why do you resist me so?

3
00:00:14,090 --> 00:00:19,100
You are a virtual lifeform that was spliced
into the genomes of Spiral races.

4
00:00:20,140 --> 00:00:22,680
When the remnants of a Spiral race
rise up in rebellion against us,

5
00:00:22,810 --> 00:00:26,770
...you would be awakened
and become our messenger.

6
00:00:27,860 --> 00:00:30,070
That is your sole reason
for being.

7
00:00:30,150 --> 00:00:34,110
The fact that you were born to a Spiral
warrior and loved by a Spiral warrior...

8
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:35,900
...is nothing more
than a coincidence.

9
00:00:36,280 --> 00:00:39,370
There is nothing special
or unique about you.

10
00:00:40,660 --> 00:00:44,960
It is a rare thing for a messenger
to be this recalcitrant.

11
00:00:45,580 --> 00:00:50,290
The reason for your defiance...
The reason for their obstinacy...

12
00:00:50,500 --> 00:00:52,880
If we can determine those,
we can surely find the key...

13
00:00:53,010 --> 00:00:55,510
...to exterminating all Spiral
lifeforms in one blow.

14
00:00:57,590 --> 00:01:02,100
No matter how deeply you probe my body,
you will never understand!

15
00:01:02,180 --> 00:01:05,850
We have no need to understand.
We only need to KNOW.

16
00:01:06,020 --> 00:01:09,310
Then you will never be able
to defeat them.

17
00:01:10,020 --> 00:01:12,940
He will come.
You can be sure of that.

18
00:01:34,260 --> 00:01:36,630
I'm here, Nia.

19
00:01:37,130 --> 00:01:39,180
Just like I promised.

20
00:01:48,940 --> 00:01:50,440
Impossible!

21
00:01:50,810 --> 00:01:55,780
Sentient lifeforms can't possibly escape
from a extradimensional labyrinth!

22
00:01:56,440 --> 00:01:58,320
Don't underestimate us!

23
00:01:58,450 --> 00:02:01,990
We don't care about time or space
or extradimensional whatevers.

24
00:02:02,450 --> 00:02:04,330
We don't give a damn
about that.

25
00:02:04,910 --> 00:02:08,460
Force your way down a path YOU
chose to take, and do it YOUR way!

26
00:02:08,580 --> 00:02:11,130
That's the
Team Dai-Gurren way!

27
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:39,780
Even when trapped
by the cycle of karma,

28
00:02:40,200 --> 00:02:42,820
...the dreams we left behind
will open the door!

29
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:45,410
Even if the infinite universe
stands in our way...

30
00:02:45,790 --> 00:02:48,830
...the seething of our blood
will determine what will be!

31
00:02:49,290 --> 00:02:51,250
We'll break through time and space...

32
00:02:51,540 --> 00:02:54,790
...to grab hold of our own path!

33
00:02:55,590 --> 00:03:01,260
<font color=#000000>Tengen Toppa  Gurren Lagann</font>

34
00:02:55,590 --> 00:02:59,260
Tengen Toppa
Gurren Lagann!

35
00:03:01,930 --> 00:03:05,930
Who the hell do you
think we are?!

36
00:03:08,270 --> 00:03:14,020
<b>Final Episode:
The Lights In The Sky Are Stars</b>

37
00:03:12,020 --> 00:03:14,020
This is surprising.

38
00:03:14,520 --> 00:03:17,730
No Spiral race
has ever made it this far.

39
00:03:17,860 --> 00:03:20,650
Being exposed to such
Spiral power,

40
00:03:20,740 --> 00:03:24,070
...it is no surprise that our messenger
was made irregular.

41
00:03:24,910 --> 00:03:26,200
As you wish.

42
00:03:26,490 --> 00:03:28,990
We will fight you on
an even playing field,

43
00:03:29,080 --> 00:03:31,710
...using the same form
that you find such comfort in.

44
00:03:33,290 --> 00:03:34,710
What does he mean?

45
00:03:34,830 --> 00:03:36,790
It is their way.

46
00:03:36,880 --> 00:03:39,630
They are trying to inflict
absolute despair on us...

47
00:03:39,710 --> 00:03:42,930
...by fighting and defeating us
on equal terms.

48
00:03:43,550 --> 00:03:45,430
Lordgenome, your body--

49
00:03:45,550 --> 00:03:49,510
We are in a Super Spiral Universe,
where thought is given form.

50
00:03:49,640 --> 00:03:53,270
This is only a temporary body,
but allow me to join you in this fight.

51
00:03:53,940 --> 00:03:55,350
I'd be honored.

52
00:03:56,610 --> 00:04:00,980
Nia. I don't believe I have the right
to act as your father after all I've done,

53
00:04:01,070 --> 00:04:02,900
...but you have done well.

54
00:04:02,990 --> 00:04:05,530
Thank you, Father.

55
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:10,120
Have you snapped out of your
1000-year doldrums, Spiral King?

56
00:04:10,580 --> 00:04:14,290
I am no king. Right now,
I am but a simple warrior.

57
00:04:14,370 --> 00:04:17,330
Just as you are, Viral.

58
00:04:17,420 --> 00:04:19,090
Yes, sir!

59
00:04:51,580 --> 00:04:53,830
Is that all you have...

60
00:04:54,660 --> 00:04:58,670
...Spiral race?

61
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:12,600
I'll handle this!

62
00:05:20,570 --> 00:05:21,900
You waste your time!

63
00:05:21,980 --> 00:05:23,480
- I'll help!
- Me, too!

64
00:05:23,610 --> 00:05:24,480
And me!

65
00:05:24,900 --> 00:05:27,900
This universe is under
our complete control!

66
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:32,160
Your chances of winning here
are zero!

67
00:05:32,370 --> 00:05:33,740
Is that a--

68
00:05:38,290 --> 00:05:39,580
Why, that's--

69
00:05:39,670 --> 00:05:42,420
That is the Anti-Spiral's homeworld!

70
00:05:42,500 --> 00:05:43,460
What?!

71
00:05:43,590 --> 00:05:45,170
She is correct.

72
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:49,300
We Anti-Spiral were once a
Spiral race like yourselves.

73
00:05:50,090 --> 00:05:53,060
But when we learned that the
evolution of Spiral Power...

74
00:05:53,140 --> 00:05:55,970
...would lead to the destruction
of the universe,

75
00:05:56,310 --> 00:05:58,730
...we annihilated all those who
possessed the power of the Spiral,

76
00:05:58,810 --> 00:06:03,190
...and drove the few surviving lifeforms
to the far corners of the universe.

77
00:06:05,650 --> 00:06:07,780
We halted our own evolution...

78
00:06:07,860 --> 00:06:11,530
...and locked ourselves away
in this pocket universe.

79
00:06:11,870 --> 00:06:15,330
On our homeworld, we sealed away our
bodies and any possibility of evolution.

80
00:06:15,450 --> 00:06:19,830
This ugly form is the symbol
of our determination!

81
00:06:26,510 --> 00:06:30,010
Foolish creatures who are
drunk on your Spiral Power...

82
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:33,390
Do you possess the resolve
to go to such lengths?

83
00:06:33,810 --> 00:06:35,890
We were prepared to defend
the universe...

84
00:06:35,970 --> 00:06:39,390
...by defeating our former fellow Spirals
and halting our bodies' evolution!

85
00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:42,940
Do you possess resolve
that is on par with ours?!

86
00:06:44,320 --> 00:06:48,940
We say no!
No! No! No! No! No!

87
00:06:49,150 --> 00:06:52,030
Not in the least!

88
00:06:55,410 --> 00:06:56,700
You possess neither will!

89
00:06:57,500 --> 00:06:59,080
Nor resolve!

90
00:06:59,960 --> 00:07:01,420
Nor reason!

91
00:07:08,090 --> 00:07:12,590
You use your Spiral Power to satisfy your
own desires, and have grown drunk on it!

92
00:07:12,890 --> 00:07:15,470
That is the Spiral races'
fundamental limitation!

93
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:18,890
It is for that reason that
we must exterminate you!

94
00:07:22,150 --> 00:07:24,650
What's going on?
We're not even denting the thing!

95
00:07:24,980 --> 00:07:27,270
We'll never be able to protect
Earth at this rate!

96
00:07:27,400 --> 00:07:29,820
He's right, until we get
back to Earth, we--

97
00:07:30,030 --> 00:07:31,490
Look! It's the Earth!

98
00:07:32,200 --> 00:07:33,910
That's really the Earth?!

99
00:07:33,990 --> 00:07:36,030
Some sort of fold in the
fabric of space-time, maybe?

100
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:37,120
Yes, probably.

101
00:07:37,200 --> 00:07:40,870
The battle between Tengen Toppa
Gurren Lagann and the Anti-Spiral...

102
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:43,670
...probably interacted with the Spiral Realm
Perceptual Teleportation System, and--

103
00:07:43,790 --> 00:07:46,380
And it created a spacetime
teleportation bypass.

104
00:07:51,880 --> 00:07:55,970
Fascinating. That is your
homeworld, is it?

105
00:08:00,430 --> 00:08:03,940
<font color=#FFC9B9>Gurren Lagann</font>

106
00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:08,940
<font color=#FFC9B9>Gurren Lagann</font>

107
00:08:12,360 --> 00:08:14,820
Sis! Sis!

108
00:08:15,530 --> 00:08:16,780
W-Wait a minute, Kiyal!

109
00:08:17,070 --> 00:08:18,830
What's the big emergency?!

110
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:21,200
Look! That!

111
00:08:26,040 --> 00:08:27,750
W-What is that?!

112
00:08:28,540 --> 00:08:30,670
I'm getting a reading on the
Perception Teleportation System!

113
00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:32,800
An unbelievably huge reading!

114
00:08:33,090 --> 00:08:35,510
That's the Anti-Spiral?

115
00:08:39,850 --> 00:08:42,350
Super Dimensional anchor!

116
00:08:45,190 --> 00:08:47,440
You think I'm gonna let you
lay a finger on my Earth?!

117
00:08:47,730 --> 00:08:49,900
- Hey, that's--
- Gurren Lagann!

118
00:08:50,440 --> 00:08:52,730
- Give it all you've got, Gabal!
- Leave it to me!

119
00:08:54,280 --> 00:08:57,160
That planet don't belong to you!

120
00:08:57,280 --> 00:09:00,410
"I Got The Best Wife
In The Universe" Swing!

121
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:08,290
Now! Eat this! And this!
And this! And this!

122
00:09:08,380 --> 00:09:09,880
That won't work.

123
00:09:10,460 --> 00:09:11,960
Probability Alteration Missiles, huh?

124
00:09:12,210 --> 00:09:13,340
I'm impressed!

125
00:09:13,510 --> 00:09:16,380
You bet! When it comes to spacey
interruptions, I'm your man!

126
00:09:17,180 --> 00:09:19,970
You continue to struggle, even
knowing what you know now?

127
00:09:20,430 --> 00:09:21,850
Of course we do!

128
00:09:22,180 --> 00:09:24,220
The tomorrow we're trying
to grab for ourselves...

129
00:09:24,850 --> 00:09:26,940
...isn't the tomorrow that
you've set out for us!

130
00:09:29,190 --> 00:09:31,980
It's the tomorrow that WE chose!
That WE chose for ourselves!

131
00:09:32,110 --> 00:09:35,650
A tomorrow we chose
out of all the infinite universes!

132
00:09:36,030 --> 00:09:37,740
We'll fight our way through!

133
00:09:37,820 --> 00:09:40,780
We'll keep fighting
and protect the universe!

134
00:09:40,870 --> 00:09:43,200
We'll stop the Spiral Nemesis, too!

135
00:09:43,290 --> 00:09:46,160
You can't possibly do all that!

136
00:09:47,750 --> 00:09:49,750
Just watch us!

137
00:09:52,590 --> 00:09:56,800
Such arrogance coming from a lowly
species that is kept suppressed by us!

138
00:09:57,090 --> 00:10:00,590
We will make you regret
your arrogance!

139
00:10:03,720 --> 00:10:05,560
I'm reading a massive
energy buildup!

140
00:10:05,730 --> 00:10:08,020
It's on par with the birth
of the universe.

141
00:10:08,310 --> 00:10:09,730
It's almost like
a big bang...

142
00:10:09,810 --> 00:10:11,730
And they're going to
hit us with that?

143
00:10:13,110 --> 00:10:20,490
Infinity Big Bang Storm!

144
00:10:20,660 --> 00:10:23,910
Burn in the everlasting hellfire
of the universe's creation!

145
00:10:23,990 --> 00:10:30,040
Be utterly annihilated, down to
the very last scrap of DNA!

146
00:10:32,040 --> 00:10:33,500
Hang in there, Darry!

147
00:10:33,590 --> 00:10:35,050
You, too, Gimmy!

148
00:10:35,130 --> 00:10:36,250
Crap!

149
00:10:40,510 --> 00:10:43,640
This is bad! We can't take
much more of this!

150
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:50,560
- Simon...
- Honey...

151
00:10:52,940 --> 00:10:56,020
It looks bad, but it will take more
than this to finish them!

152
00:11:03,370 --> 00:11:05,950
Not yet!
We're not done yet!

153
00:11:06,330 --> 00:11:09,790
Simon! Leave this to me!

154
00:11:19,880 --> 00:11:23,390
Lazengann Overload!

155
00:11:29,350 --> 00:11:30,310
Father!

156
00:11:31,140 --> 00:11:33,690
Do not grieve for me, daughter.

157
00:11:35,190 --> 00:11:39,650
My soul once drowned in a sea of despair
and weariness, but has been reawakened.

158
00:11:39,820 --> 00:11:43,070
If the life of this temporary body will
create a tomorrow for all Spiral life,

159
00:11:43,160 --> 00:11:44,910
...I will gladly give it.

160
00:11:45,030 --> 00:11:48,080
Yes. I agree with you completely.

161
00:11:48,200 --> 00:11:50,160
Nia, what are--

162
00:11:55,170 --> 00:12:00,090
Simon, you've come all this way so that
you could do what you had to do.

163
00:12:00,920 --> 00:12:02,760
Isn't that right?

164
00:12:04,340 --> 00:12:07,180
I understand.
We'll win this fight.

165
00:12:07,560 --> 00:12:09,060
Count on it.

166
00:12:10,060 --> 00:12:11,270
Obviously.

167
00:12:11,350 --> 00:12:14,730
Your deaths will be for nothing!
Now, begone!

168
00:12:15,810 --> 00:12:17,980
Lazengann is undergoing
quantum breakdown!

169
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:21,940
That's what I was
waiting for!

170
00:12:28,370 --> 00:12:32,000
Simon! Take it!

171
00:12:42,420 --> 00:12:45,180
Lordgenome!
Let's do this together!

172
00:12:48,510 --> 00:12:51,680
Impossible! He allowed himself
to undergo quantum breakdown...

173
00:12:51,810 --> 00:12:53,810
...so he could become one
with the energy?

174
00:12:54,690 --> 00:12:56,020
Eat this!

175
00:12:56,100 --> 00:12:59,190
Never!

176
00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:14,250
How can this be?

177
00:13:14,830 --> 00:13:17,580
Where are you drawing
this power from?

178
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:21,380
We evolve beyond the person
we were a minute before.

179
00:13:21,920 --> 00:13:25,470
Little by little, we advance a
little further with each turn.

180
00:13:25,590 --> 00:13:27,840
That's how a drill works!

181
00:13:28,010 --> 00:13:30,470
That is the path that
leads to extinction!

182
00:13:30,550 --> 00:13:34,600
Why can't you see the limitation
of the Spiral races?

183
00:13:35,680 --> 00:13:37,810
No, that's YOUR limitation!

184
00:13:38,150 --> 00:13:39,770
You sit here in your
closed-off universe,

185
00:13:39,900 --> 00:13:42,690
...locking away other lifeforms
like you're some kind of king!

186
00:13:42,780 --> 00:13:45,070
That's nobody's limitation
but your own!

187
00:13:48,110 --> 00:13:52,160
He's right! We humans used to have
somebody much, much bigger than us!

188
00:13:52,370 --> 00:13:55,290
For his sake,
we'll move forward!

189
00:13:55,700 --> 00:13:59,580
The human spirit is limitless! I've staked
everything on its greatness, too!

190
00:14:01,540 --> 00:14:06,130
Mark my words. This drill will
open a hole in the universe.

191
00:14:06,260 --> 00:14:09,340
And that hole will become a path
for those that follow after us.

192
00:14:09,760 --> 00:14:13,720
The dreams of those who have fallen.
The hopes of those who will follow.

193
00:14:14,270 --> 00:14:17,480
Those two sets of dreams weave
together into a double helix,

194
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:19,600
...drilling a path
towards tomorrow.

195
00:14:20,730 --> 00:14:24,980
That's Tengen Toppa!
That's Gurren Lagann!

196
00:14:25,690 --> 00:14:30,700
My drill is the drill that
creates the heavens!

197
00:14:54,310 --> 00:14:55,930
Simon!

198
00:14:58,430 --> 00:15:01,600
Get in there!

199
00:15:04,980 --> 00:15:08,230
Lagann Impact!

200
00:15:14,780 --> 00:15:21,330
If this is how it must be,
protect the universe at all costs...

201
00:15:26,500 --> 00:15:30,300
Of course we will.
Humanity isn't that stupid.

202
00:15:56,620 --> 00:15:57,780
What happened?

203
00:15:57,910 --> 00:16:02,540
The energy that maintained that universe
between dimensions has vanished.

204
00:16:06,790 --> 00:16:10,420
Simon! Do you read me?!
Simon!

205
00:16:10,840 --> 00:16:15,130
We're being contacted by one planet after
another from across the galaxy!

206
00:16:15,890 --> 00:16:20,430
The freed Spiral races are
sending us messages of joy!

207
00:16:21,060 --> 00:16:24,730
There are so many others
like us out there!

208
00:16:26,360 --> 00:16:28,560
Simon!

209
00:16:35,820 --> 00:16:37,620
It's all over, Nia.

210
00:16:38,410 --> 00:16:39,870
Yes.

211
00:16:40,660 --> 00:16:42,450
Let's go home.

212
00:16:47,540 --> 00:16:50,380
Welcome home, Mistress Nia.

213
00:16:51,880 --> 00:16:54,300
Thank you, Old Coco.

214
00:16:55,340 --> 00:16:57,510
Look at this, Simon!
See?

215
00:16:59,220 --> 00:17:00,390
It's beautiful.

216
00:17:02,680 --> 00:17:05,890
Thank you.
I mean it.

217
00:17:40,470 --> 00:17:43,470
Nia, I'll never forget you.

218
00:17:43,680 --> 00:17:45,310
Even if the universe ends.

219
00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:47,730
Don't be silly.
It won't end.

220
00:17:47,810 --> 00:17:50,440
That's what we've all
worked so hard for.

221
00:17:50,860 --> 00:17:53,270
Yeah. You're right.

222
00:17:54,780 --> 00:17:57,070
I love you, Simon.

223
00:17:57,200 --> 00:17:59,240
Yeah. Me, too.

224
00:18:00,160 --> 00:18:02,160
I love you.

225
00:18:12,710 --> 00:18:14,420
Simon...

226
00:18:15,090 --> 00:18:18,220
It's all right.
We knew this would happen.

227
00:18:18,340 --> 00:18:19,180
Nia and I knew.

228
00:18:19,300 --> 00:18:20,680
But it's not--

229
00:18:20,930 --> 00:18:25,010
Defeating the Anti-Spiral meant
that this was going to happen.

230
00:18:25,180 --> 00:18:28,850
Nia was a virtual lifeform
created by the Anti-Spiral.

231
00:18:29,270 --> 00:18:31,900
I suppose we should be amazed that
she hung on as long as she did.

232
00:18:31,980 --> 00:18:34,150
She always was
one tough cookie.

233
00:18:35,690 --> 00:18:39,610
Then... Then you... Then you should
just use the power of the Spiral!

234
00:18:40,200 --> 00:18:43,240
You can use that power
to bring Nia back!

235
00:18:43,330 --> 00:18:46,330
And not just her!
All the other people we lost!

236
00:18:46,580 --> 00:18:49,370
Simon isn't God, Gimmy.

237
00:18:51,540 --> 00:18:53,630
Those who are dead
are dead.

238
00:18:53,710 --> 00:18:58,300
If we bring them back to life, they'll just get
in the way of the next generation, right?

239
00:19:01,090 --> 00:19:03,010
It's in your hands now, Rossiu.

240
00:19:03,100 --> 00:19:04,510
Simon...

241
00:19:05,060 --> 00:19:07,720
Me, I'm Simon the Digger.

242
00:19:07,810 --> 00:19:11,190
There's someone better suited
to go through the tunnels I dug.

243
00:19:12,520 --> 00:19:14,730
You can count on me.

244
00:19:19,490 --> 00:19:21,610
It was fun while
it lasted, Simon.

245
00:19:22,070 --> 00:19:23,780
Simon!

246
00:21:15,270 --> 00:21:19,060
The Galactic Spiral Peace Conference...
I hope it goes well.

247
00:21:19,190 --> 00:21:21,150
We may be fellow
Spiral races,

248
00:21:21,230 --> 00:21:23,860
...but we're different species, and we
all have different ways of thinking.

249
00:21:23,940 --> 00:21:26,900
In the end, it's taken 20 years
to put it together.

250
00:21:27,240 --> 00:21:31,240
The job would have been impossible
for anyone else, President Rossiu.

251
00:21:31,990 --> 00:21:34,870
I wonder what he's up to...

252
00:21:35,080 --> 00:21:38,080
Don't worry. He's out there somewhere,
watching over us.

253
00:21:38,500 --> 00:21:41,000
That's the sort of man
he is.

254
00:21:45,300 --> 00:21:47,550
This is Nakim. I've been selected
to represent the entire galaxy...

255
00:21:47,630 --> 00:21:49,340
...as a member of the
Grapearl Squadron.

256
00:21:49,890 --> 00:21:54,310
We won't allow the Spiral Nemesis to occur.
Well, I'm off, Miss Yomako.

257
00:21:54,560 --> 00:21:57,440
- Goodbye!
- Goodbye, Principal Yomako!

258
00:21:57,690 --> 00:21:59,770
Goodbye!

259
00:22:08,160 --> 00:22:10,410
It's finally time, Gimmy.

260
00:22:10,660 --> 00:22:12,200
Yeah.

261
00:22:18,080 --> 00:22:21,540
Captain, the Grapearl Forces are about
to lift off from the surface.

262
00:22:21,670 --> 00:22:24,800
Good! Spin up the
Super Spiral Engines!

263
00:22:24,880 --> 00:22:28,550
As soon as the Grapearl Squadron is
aboard, Super Teleport into deep space!

264
00:22:28,970 --> 00:22:33,260
We're representing Earth out there!
Put some spirit into it, people!

265
00:19:41,520 --> 00:19:45,780
<font color=#FFFF00>Dakara kakko tsukenaide motto jibun wo shinjite

What's wrong, kid?

286
00:22:56,620 --> 00:22:58,830
I can't drill a hole
in this thing...

287
00:22:59,580 --> 00:23:03,170
You're putting too much force into it.
Try turning the drill more gently.

288
00:23:03,960 --> 00:23:05,340
Like this?

289
00:23:08,130 --> 00:23:10,300
Hey, it worked!
You're awesome, mister!

290
00:23:10,800 --> 00:23:13,840
Of course it worked!
Who the hell do you think--

291
00:23:18,520 --> 00:23:19,980
Yum!

292
00:23:21,140 --> 00:23:24,230
Nah, I guess I'm nobody.

293
00:23:27,150 --> 00:23:31,240
Awesome! It's Gurren Lagann!
Look at all the Gurren Laganns!

294
00:23:33,660 --> 00:23:35,700
You know, I think you're right.

295
00:23:36,280 --> 00:23:38,330
I wonder if I can go, too?

296
00:23:38,410 --> 00:23:42,870
Sure you can. The lights
in the sky are stars.

297
00:23:49,130 --> 00:23:54,760
Yeah, they're stars. Stars where our
Spiral cousins are waiting for us.

298
00:24:00,850 --> 00:24:04,850
<b>The End</b>
