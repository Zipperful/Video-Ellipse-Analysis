00:00:10,670 --> 00:00:15,510
Gurren Lagann

2
00:00:15,580 --> 00:00:18,110
<font color=#FFFF00>Kimi ha kikoeru?
</font>Can you hear it?

3
00:00:18,250 --> 00:00:26,250
<font color=#FFFF00>Boku no kono koe ga yami ni munashiku suikomareta
</font>This voice of mine was sucked emptily into darkness

4
00:00:26,600 --> 00:00:31,700
<font color=#FFFF00>Moshimo sekai ga imi wo motsu no nara
</font>If the world has meaning to it,

5
00:00:32,030 --> 00:00:36,570
<font color=#FFFF00>Konna kimochi mo muda de ha nai
</font>Then these kinds of feelings aren't futile

6
00:00:36,910 --> 00:00:42,610
<font color=#FFFF00>Akogare ni oshitsubusarete akirametetanda
</font>I was crushed by my longing and had given up

7
00:00:42,910 --> 00:00:47,870
<font color=#FFFF00>Hateshinai sora no iro mo shiranaide
</font>Without even knowing the color of the endless sky

8
00:00:48,280 --> 00:00:53,190
<font color=#FFFF00>Hashiridashita omoi ga ima demo
</font>I began to run, because my feelings, even now,

9
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:58,960
<font color=#FFFF00>Kono mune wo tashika ni tataiteru kara
</font>Are definitely beating against my heart

10
00:00:59,230 --> 00:01:04,030
<font color=#FFFF00>Kyou no boku ga sono saki ni tsudzuku
</font>The me of today will continue towards our destination

11
00:01:04,500 --> 00:01:10,060
<font color=#FFFF00>Bokura nari no asu wo kizuite yuku
</font>We'll amass our own tomorrows

12
00:01:10,410 --> 00:01:18,900
<font color=#FFFF00>Kotae ha sou itsumo koko ni aru
</font>The answer, yes, is always right here

13
00:01:31,670 --> 00:01:36,260
This is the tale of a man who continues
to fight against destiny.

14
00:01:36,420 --> 00:01:41,350
Simon uses fighting to try to distract himself
from the hard blow of losing Kamina.

15
00:01:41,640 --> 00:01:44,010
Lagann goes out of control,
and when it stops,

16
00:01:44,430 --> 00:01:48,440
...Simon meets a mysterious girl
who appears from out of a box.

17
00:01:48,940 --> 00:01:54,020
When Adiane, the Elegant, one of the
Four Generals, attacks Dai-Gurren,

18
00:01:54,360 --> 00:01:56,690
...the girl runs out
and says the following:

19
00:01:58,570 --> 00:02:01,700
First Princess Nia, daughter of
Spiral King Lordgenome, orders you!

20
00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:03,870
Leave us!

21
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:13,750
<b>One of the Four Generals: Adiane, the Elegant</b>

22
00:02:06,500 --> 00:02:09,370
- Impossible!
- She says she's Princess Nia, ma'am...

23
00:02:09,370 --> 00:02:11,080
Don't be stupid!

24
00:02:11,080 --> 00:02:13,750
A princess wouldn't go wondering
around outside the Capital!

25
00:02:14,300 --> 00:02:18,220
But ma'am, she looks
exactly like her.

26
00:02:18,470 --> 00:02:25,680
<b>Adiane's Custom Gunmen:
Sayrune</b>

27
00:02:18,470 --> 00:02:22,640
You think so? In that case, we'll just
kill her and pretend we never saw her!

28
00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:25,680
General Adiane, please watch what you say!

29
00:02:25,850 --> 00:02:28,600
All of our transmissions
are being recorded!

30
00:02:33,190 --> 00:02:34,570
Her back is turned!

31
00:02:35,110 --> 00:02:37,900
Did our little princess
really stop her?

32
00:02:38,150 --> 00:02:39,570
Fire main cannons!
Fire! Fire! Fire!

33
00:02:39,650 --> 00:02:42,360
Weren't you listening?
They're still offline.

34
00:02:42,450 --> 00:02:45,910
Listen, stinking humans!
Get this straight, I'm not retreating!

35
00:02:46,200 --> 00:02:47,910
I'll be back, got it?

36
00:02:56,300 --> 00:02:57,960
What's a "princess"?

37
00:03:00,090 --> 00:03:02,430
It's what you call the
daughter of a king.

38
00:03:03,010 --> 00:03:07,180
Unbelievable, we've got the daughter
of the guy we're fighting on board.

39
00:03:07,810 --> 00:03:10,560
Does this mean we use
her as a hostage?

40
00:03:11,600 --> 00:03:12,640
What's the plan, Kittan?

41
00:03:12,770 --> 00:03:15,310
- Yeah, what's the plan?
- Tell us the plan!

42
00:03:15,730 --> 00:03:18,650
In any case, we'll interrogate her
first thing tomorrow morning.

43
00:03:18,740 --> 00:03:21,900
I'll put the screws to her and make her
spill everything she knows!

<font color=#000000>Episode 10:
Who Is This Bro?</font>

45
00:03:28,240 --> 00:03:34,040
<b>Teppelin, Royal Capital Audience Chamber</b>

46
00:03:29,370 --> 00:03:34,040
Adiane, the Elegant, fled in the face the enemy?

47
00:03:34,130 --> 00:03:36,040
What manner of joke is this?

48
00:03:36,130 --> 00:03:42,090
Sire. The dastardly enemy was
holding Princess Nia hostage.

49
00:03:42,220 --> 00:03:43,970
You fool.

50
00:03:44,800 --> 00:03:48,180
I have long since cast her out.

51
00:03:48,260 --> 00:03:50,180
I do not care what happens to her.

52
00:03:50,310 --> 00:03:56,810
Cast her out? But Sire, I was not
informed of this development...

53
00:03:57,320 --> 00:04:02,240
You dare use that to
excuse your failure?

54
00:04:02,320 --> 00:04:03,200
No, Sire.

55
00:04:03,240 --> 00:04:07,280
Adiane, you committed the grave offense
of fleeing in the face of the enemy,

56
00:04:07,370 --> 00:04:10,490
...all to protect a girl who
is no longer a princess.

57
00:04:10,830 --> 00:04:13,750
Oh, the absurdity of it all...

58
00:04:15,790 --> 00:04:19,960
Please, Sire!
Give me another chance.

59
00:04:20,090 --> 00:04:23,420
Oh? You dare tell me
what to do?

60
00:04:23,510 --> 00:04:24,930
I would not dream of it, Sire!

61
00:04:25,010 --> 00:04:26,470
What is it, then?

62
00:04:26,510 --> 00:04:30,970
To prove my loyalty, I shall
set out alone in Sayrune.

63
00:04:31,020 --> 00:04:35,770
I shall wipe out all the humans,
along with Dai-Gunzan,

64
00:04:35,850 --> 00:04:38,190
...and kill Nia along with them
before sunset tomorrow.

65
00:04:38,730 --> 00:04:42,900
Very well. But bear in mind that you
will not receive another chance.

66
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:45,030
Go.

67
00:04:47,990 --> 00:04:49,870
- General Adiane.
- Ah, Viral.

68
00:04:49,910 --> 00:04:51,740
I was under the impression
that you were badly injured.

69
00:04:51,790 --> 00:04:54,870
No, ma'am. I will be returning
to my home unit tomorrow.

70
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:59,210
My failure to protect General Thymilph
is the greatest failure of my life.

71
00:04:59,340 --> 00:05:02,090
That said, I would like
to ask a favor of--

72
00:05:06,220 --> 00:05:07,550
General Adiane...

73
00:05:07,640 --> 00:05:10,260
Go on.
I'll hear you out.

74
00:05:11,010 --> 00:05:12,810
During your next sortie--

75
00:05:13,060 --> 00:05:14,560
I ask that you--

76
00:05:14,930 --> 00:05:16,350
Allow me--

77
00:05:16,440 --> 00:05:17,850
To--

78
00:05:18,520 --> 00:05:19,770
Accompany--

79
00:05:19,900 --> 00:05:20,810
You.

80
00:05:22,150 --> 00:05:27,200
I had Thymilph in my debt, but with
him dead, it was all for nothing!

81
00:05:27,450 --> 00:05:29,910
And it's all because
you're so worthless!

82
00:05:30,580 --> 00:05:33,830
W-Which is why I beg you to give me
a chance to avenge him.

83
00:05:34,250 --> 00:05:37,500
I've already decided that I will be
going out myself tomorrow morning.

84
00:05:37,750 --> 00:05:39,670
Go back to your den.

85
00:05:40,130 --> 00:05:43,460
I will be the one who
will avenge Thymilph.

86
00:05:48,630 --> 00:05:52,970
Hey, shove all the unusable parts outside!
We can't do any work with 'em in the way!

87
00:05:56,180 --> 00:05:57,600
Thank you for the meal.

88
00:05:58,440 --> 00:06:00,100
- Thanks for the meal!
- Thanks for the meal!

89
00:06:01,150 --> 00:06:02,560
Yum!

90
00:06:03,320 --> 00:06:05,690
What's this stuff?
It looks great!

91
00:06:05,780 --> 00:06:07,320
I can't cut mine...

92
00:06:07,450 --> 00:06:10,030
Just a moment,
I'll cut it for you.

93
00:06:11,200 --> 00:06:14,530
So, anyway... Um...
Princess?

94
00:06:14,790 --> 00:06:16,910
Yes? Would you
like some, too?

95
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:18,370
Open wide!

96
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,290
Hey, that's good...

97
00:06:23,670 --> 00:06:25,840
Old Coco is a really
good cook...

98
00:06:26,210 --> 00:06:28,130
- Really?
- You serious?

99
00:06:29,130 --> 00:06:33,720
What are you guys, stupid?! Why are you
sitting around over a friendly dinner?!

100
00:06:33,810 --> 00:06:36,350
You don't have to roll out the
red carpet for her like this!

101
00:06:36,470 --> 00:06:39,850
We're here to do an interrogation, remember?!
An interrogation!

102
00:06:42,060 --> 00:06:45,150
How do you do?
My name is Nia.

103
00:06:45,230 --> 00:06:47,190
And what is your name?

104
00:06:48,860 --> 00:06:50,360
I'm Kittan!

105
00:06:50,740 --> 00:06:55,700
I'm the eldest of the Black Siblings,
and I'm the leader of Team Gurren!

106
00:06:56,240 --> 00:06:58,580
Ah, Kittan, is it?
It's nice to meet you.

107
00:06:59,870 --> 00:07:05,000
Just 'cause you're cute don't change
the fact that you're the enemy!

108
00:07:05,090 --> 00:07:08,090
- Yeah! She enemy!
- Yeah, he's right! She enemy!

109
00:07:08,510 --> 00:07:12,010
Kittan? What does "enemy" mean?

110
00:07:13,220 --> 00:07:17,430
An enemy is a bad person!
Somebody you gotta beat the crap out of!

111
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:20,020
Beat the... crap out of?
And what does that mean?

112
00:07:20,730 --> 00:07:24,520
Well, uh... That's when you take
your fist and belt the guy, and--

113
00:07:24,650 --> 00:07:26,310
What does "fist" mean?

114
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:27,980
Well, a fist is--

115
00:07:28,070 --> 00:07:30,070
Why would you do that?

116
00:07:30,190 --> 00:07:32,030
Duh! Because they piss me off!

117
00:07:32,110 --> 00:07:33,860
What does "pissed off" mean?

118
00:07:33,950 --> 00:07:37,950
- He came to interrogate HER--
- But he's being interrogated instead.

119
00:07:38,080 --> 00:07:40,500
Our bro isn't too good
around her type.

120
00:07:40,620 --> 00:07:42,250
Butt out!

121
00:07:42,580 --> 00:07:48,250
Kittan, you are, um... a not-pissing-off
person who is very sweet.

122
00:07:48,460 --> 00:07:50,880
Thank you! Our talk has been
very informative!

123
00:07:52,300 --> 00:07:57,010
Well, sure! I'm the leader,
so it's only natural.

124
00:08:06,940 --> 00:08:10,940
Hey, Simon. I've got an order
for you as team leader.

125
00:08:11,400 --> 00:08:13,740
I want you to get all the enemy intel
you can out of Nia.

126
00:08:14,280 --> 00:08:15,320
Why me?

127
00:08:15,410 --> 00:08:19,490
Just do it. You were the one
who brought her here.

128
00:08:19,620 --> 00:08:21,040
Man up and do something
about it.

129
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:24,710
She's a formidable opponent.
Know that you're in for a tough fight.

130
00:08:26,920 --> 00:08:29,420
I heard many things
from Kittan.

131
00:08:29,500 --> 00:08:32,960
He said that my father is doing terrible things
to the people on the surface.

132
00:08:33,260 --> 00:08:37,640
But I find it hard to imagine that Father
would do such things without good reason.

133
00:08:37,720 --> 00:08:41,430
And yet, I also do not believe
that the people here are bad.

134
00:08:41,890 --> 00:08:44,310
We didn't do anything wrong.

135
00:08:44,390 --> 00:08:47,190
It's the Spiral King who's the bad guy here.
Him and his people.

136
00:08:47,520 --> 00:08:49,900
Do you hate my father?

137
00:08:49,980 --> 00:08:51,610
Of course.

138
00:08:51,780 --> 00:08:53,650
Do you also hate me?

139
00:08:53,780 --> 00:08:56,070
I don't know anything
about you.

140
00:08:56,160 --> 00:08:58,660
Why do you fight, then?

141
00:08:58,740 --> 00:09:01,700
It was my Bro who gave me
the strength to fight.

142
00:09:01,790 --> 00:09:04,370
Because he was there
to believe in me.

143
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:07,790
Simon.

144
00:09:08,420 --> 00:09:11,670
Who is this Bro person?

145
00:09:11,960 --> 00:09:14,920
Do you think Simon
will be all right?

146
00:09:15,220 --> 00:09:17,840
Don't you have other things
to worry about?

147
00:09:17,970 --> 00:09:21,470
If I don't finally get
Dai-Gurren here running again,

148
00:09:21,560 --> 00:09:23,810
...a lot more than tears
will be spilled here.

149
00:09:24,140 --> 00:09:26,600
Yes, but in Simon's case, he--

150
00:09:27,520 --> 00:09:31,440
We're all fighting here.
That goes for you, too, right?

151
00:09:31,650 --> 00:09:32,480
Yes...

152
00:09:32,690 --> 00:09:35,240
Besides, if the reason that
Lagann isn't working...

153
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:38,990
...is because it doesn't feel like helping
a kid who's lost the will to survive,

154
00:09:39,240 --> 00:09:41,780
...I think it has the right idea.

155
00:09:43,490 --> 00:09:46,620
Oh, I see. He was killed
in a battle recently.

156
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:52,880
In that case, I suppose it's no wonder
that everyone here hates me.

157
00:09:53,210 --> 00:09:56,380
No one hates you, Nia.

158
00:09:56,470 --> 00:10:00,760
I don't think that Kamina
fought out of hatred.

159
00:10:01,260 --> 00:10:06,810
It's hard to explain, but no matter how bad
the situation, he was always laughing.

160
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:09,350
I guess he was...

161
00:10:10,060 --> 00:10:12,690
A man whose stupidity
knew no bounds.

162
00:10:15,110 --> 00:10:18,240
I'd like to hear about him, too.
Keep talking.

163
00:10:18,780 --> 00:10:21,240
This happened long before
we met you, Yoko.

164
00:10:21,410 --> 00:10:25,830
We tried to break out of our
underground village ourselves.

165
00:10:26,290 --> 00:10:30,290
But along the way, there was an earthquake,
and we were trapped.

166
00:10:30,750 --> 00:10:32,250
Hey, I know this--

167
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,550
Never mind. Keep going.

168
00:10:35,800 --> 00:10:41,340
I was terrified that I was going to be
buried alive just like my mom and dad were.

169
00:10:42,470 --> 00:10:48,020
But Kamina urged us on, yelling,
"Onwards and upwards, men!"

170
00:10:48,140 --> 00:10:49,480
Laughing all the while.

171
00:10:50,690 --> 00:10:53,230
My hands stopped shaking.

172
00:10:53,770 --> 00:10:57,570
When I'm focused on drilling, I can hear
the soil and the rocks calling to me.

173
00:10:57,650 --> 00:11:00,650
"It's softer this way,"
or "Try digging over here!"

174
00:11:01,070 --> 00:11:04,200
I follow their advice as I dig.

175
00:11:04,530 --> 00:11:09,660
But if we'd have given up that day,
we all would have died.

176
00:11:09,960 --> 00:11:12,750
The reason we didn't
was because of my Bro.

177
00:11:13,420 --> 00:11:16,460
Because he didn't give up.

178
00:11:16,670 --> 00:11:18,590
That's how he always was.

179
00:11:19,130 --> 00:11:22,510
Without him,
I can't do anything.

180
00:11:23,390 --> 00:11:28,430
That's why I have to become like him,
so I can do his share for him.

181
00:11:29,310 --> 00:11:30,730
That's not true.

182
00:11:31,770 --> 00:11:35,270
You rescued me
all by yourself, remember?

183
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:36,360
That wasn't--

184
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:38,820
You can do just fine
on your own.

185
00:11:38,900 --> 00:11:42,030
Why are you obsessing so much
over this "Bro" person?

186
00:11:42,150 --> 00:11:43,490
Why? Because--

187
00:11:43,660 --> 00:11:46,280
You're just saying that because
you didn't know him.

188
00:11:47,450 --> 00:11:50,120
I can't get to know
a dead person.

189
00:11:50,450 --> 00:11:54,460
But you also can't rely
on a dead person, Simon.

190
00:11:54,580 --> 00:11:55,710
Nia!

191
00:11:55,840 --> 00:11:58,170
You can't know
how Simon is feeling!

192
00:11:58,500 --> 00:12:00,880
You didn't even know Kamina!

193
00:12:01,260 --> 00:12:04,970
I may not have known this Bro person,
but I do understand Simon.

194
00:12:05,010 --> 00:12:07,050
Simon is not a helpless person.

195
00:12:07,140 --> 00:12:10,640
He mustn't keep dwelling
over a dead man.

196
00:12:11,140 --> 00:12:14,520
Don't talk like you're an innocent
bystander in all this, lady!

197
00:12:14,650 --> 00:12:17,400
You know perfectly well
whose fault it is that Kamina died!

198
00:12:17,940 --> 00:12:21,610
So don't you dare stand there
and calmly lecture him!

199
00:12:24,570 --> 00:12:26,780
I apologize.

200
00:12:28,700 --> 00:12:33,500
What you said is right. No amount
of grieving will bring Kamina back.

201
00:12:33,830 --> 00:12:35,750
We know that.

202
00:12:35,880 --> 00:12:38,750
Maybe it would be easier
if we could forget about him.

203
00:12:38,920 --> 00:12:45,180
But we can't just... forget about him
like he was nothing!

204
00:12:59,770 --> 00:13:02,610
She had tears in her eyes...

205
00:13:02,780 --> 00:13:04,690
It isn't your fault, Nia.

206
00:13:05,280 --> 00:13:08,910
I want to learn more
about you and your people.

207
00:13:11,540 --> 00:13:15,040
<font color=#FFC9B9>Gurren Lagann</font>

208
00:13:16,540 --> 00:13:20,040
<font color=#FFC9B9>Gurren Lagann</font>

209
00:13:27,890 --> 00:13:30,300
W-What the hell is that?!

210
00:13:30,970 --> 00:13:33,220
We've got trouble! A wall of water
is coming this way!

211
00:13:33,350 --> 00:13:33,810
Water?

212
00:13:33,930 --> 00:13:36,060
Maybe he's seeing things
after being up all--

213
00:13:45,610 --> 00:13:47,320
An enemy Gunmen
is on our deck!

214
00:13:50,280 --> 00:13:53,790
I've returned, just as I promised!
You stinking humans!

215
00:13:53,910 --> 00:13:55,830
What the hell was--

216
00:13:56,250 --> 00:13:57,500
It's that chick with the fins
from yesterday!

217
00:13:57,670 --> 00:14:02,460
First of all, would you be so kind as
to let me see our dear princess?

218
00:14:02,920 --> 00:14:05,260
I need to thank her for all the things
she's done for me.

219
00:14:05,340 --> 00:14:07,630
That bitch! The nerve of coming
with just one Gunmen!

220
00:14:07,720 --> 00:14:08,800
I'm gonna deck her!

221
00:14:08,880 --> 00:14:11,590
Wait a minute.
Dai-Gurren still can't move.

222
00:14:11,680 --> 00:14:13,560
We need to buy
all the time we can.

223
00:14:13,640 --> 00:14:16,350
Good point...
Okay, let's hand over Nia!

224
00:14:16,810 --> 00:14:17,810
We can't do that!

225
00:14:17,890 --> 00:14:22,860
Say what?! You got a problem with the
decisions of your mighty leader?!

226
00:14:22,940 --> 00:14:25,980
I'm not sure why, but something tells me
that would be a risky move.

227
00:14:26,190 --> 00:14:29,820
Don't give me that half-assed crap!
Come out and say it! Quit yammering!

228
00:14:29,910 --> 00:14:31,950
I will go.

229
00:14:34,200 --> 00:14:37,620
Hear that? She says
she's okay with it.

230
00:14:37,660 --> 00:14:38,870
Yeah, but--

231
00:14:38,960 --> 00:14:43,920
Don't worry. She might
be able to avoid a fight.

232
00:14:44,590 --> 00:14:47,130
Thank you, Yoko.

233
00:14:47,380 --> 00:14:50,340
This doesn't mean that I trust you.

234
00:14:51,140 --> 00:14:53,680
I'll have this rifle
trained on your back.

235
00:14:54,140 --> 00:14:56,390
If I see any funny business,
I won't hesitate, got it?!

236
00:14:58,730 --> 00:15:00,060
Yes.

237
00:15:00,350 --> 00:15:02,850
I see that you are well,
Princess Nia.

238
00:15:03,400 --> 00:15:05,230
Tell me, Adiane.

239
00:15:05,400 --> 00:15:10,280
Are you and the others making the
humans here on the surface suffer?

240
00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:20,120
It is as you say. Our duty is to slaughter
every last human we find on the surface.

241
00:15:20,370 --> 00:15:23,630
Were you ordered to do this
by my father?

242
00:15:23,830 --> 00:15:24,830
Yes.

243
00:15:25,040 --> 00:15:28,800
And you harbored no doubts
about these orders?

244
00:15:29,090 --> 00:15:31,010
Doubts? Never.

245
00:15:31,050 --> 00:15:34,430
Humans are as lowly as worms.

246
00:15:34,510 --> 00:15:38,470
Their death and suffering
is beneath our notice.

247
00:15:38,560 --> 00:15:39,970
"Worms," huh?

248
00:15:40,060 --> 00:15:43,390
I cannot believe this!
I will discuss this with my father!

249
00:15:43,730 --> 00:15:47,270
Adiane, take me
to my father at once!

250
00:15:47,570 --> 00:15:49,440
You piss me off,
you flake!

251
00:15:49,570 --> 00:15:52,150
If you wanna go, take your
own sorry ass there!

252
00:15:52,490 --> 00:15:54,030
What did you say?

253
00:15:54,160 --> 00:15:58,620
It hasn't sunk in yet?
You aren't a princess anymore!

254
00:15:58,700 --> 00:16:03,120
The Spiral King has abandoned you!
Cut you off! Thrown you out!

255
00:16:03,370 --> 00:16:07,750
I don't know what you did, but he said
to kill you along with the worms!

256
00:16:07,880 --> 00:16:10,460
Abandoned me?
Kill me?

257
00:16:10,880 --> 00:16:12,300
Father said for you
to kill me?

258
00:16:12,880 --> 00:16:15,010
Abandoned her?

259
00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:23,390
Lagann! Work!
Please work!

260
00:16:23,480 --> 00:16:27,060
I was right! She didn't
come here to bring Nia back!

261
00:16:27,270 --> 00:16:30,780
This cannot be true!
Father would never do such a thing!

262
00:16:30,860 --> 00:16:33,570
He wouldn't, huh?
Think whatever you want!

263
00:16:33,780 --> 00:16:36,700
I'm sending you to the next world
in a few seconds, missy!

264
00:16:37,950 --> 00:16:40,120
Do you hate me, as well?

265
00:16:40,330 --> 00:16:43,330
Hate you? I couldn't
care less about you.

266
00:16:45,830 --> 00:16:50,090
I was told to kill you,
so that's what I'm going to do!

267
00:16:51,170 --> 00:16:53,880
Whether I hate you or not
doesn't enter into it!

268
00:16:54,220 --> 00:16:58,590
You would kill me simply because
you were ordered to do so?

269
00:16:59,010 --> 00:17:00,510
Of course I would!

270
00:17:00,640 --> 00:17:04,020
Then if my father told you to die,
would you do that, as well?!

271
00:17:07,270 --> 00:17:08,980
You are wrong!

272
00:17:09,730 --> 00:17:12,400
These people have done
nothing wrong!

273
00:17:12,740 --> 00:17:16,070
Their only wish is to live
on the surface in peace!

274
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:19,240
It cannot be right to kill them
for no reason.

275
00:17:19,370 --> 00:17:21,530
These people killed Thymilph.

276
00:17:21,620 --> 00:17:22,950
They did?

277
00:17:23,040 --> 00:17:25,370
That should be reason enough!

278
00:17:25,580 --> 00:17:29,380
No. No, you're wrong.
That isn't right.

279
00:17:29,590 --> 00:17:32,300
They themselves have lost
a man they call Bro.

280
00:17:32,420 --> 00:17:34,880
This loss has left them
sorely wounded.

281
00:17:35,340 --> 00:17:39,800
Yes, that is what happens
when someone dies.

282
00:17:40,010 --> 00:17:42,680
People suffer,
and they hurt inside.

283
00:17:42,810 --> 00:17:45,270
And yet here you are, saying that two
grieving parties should hurt each other!

284
00:17:46,020 --> 00:17:48,020
Don't you think that there is
something wrong with that?

285
00:17:48,190 --> 00:17:50,100
NO, I DON'T!

286
00:17:51,360 --> 00:17:53,480
Fine, have it your way!
You piece of crap!

287
00:17:55,240 --> 00:17:56,990
Nia!

288
00:17:59,530 --> 00:18:01,740
You really know how
to piss people off!

289
00:18:01,830 --> 00:18:04,450
Now I know why the Spiral King
got rid of you!

290
00:18:04,750 --> 00:18:07,960
Yes, now I see!
You are a pissing-off person!

291
00:18:08,040 --> 00:18:09,920
That's my line, missy!

292
00:18:10,380 --> 00:18:12,500
- Nia!
- Simon!

293
00:18:12,710 --> 00:18:13,960
Simon!

294
00:18:14,420 --> 00:18:16,260
Nia!

295
00:18:18,550 --> 00:18:22,760
He threw out his own daughter?!
That's one thing I won't stand for!

296
00:18:22,930 --> 00:18:24,180
- Won't stand for it!
- Smash!

297
00:18:24,260 --> 00:18:26,430
DIE!

298
00:18:29,190 --> 00:18:30,600
You guys take it from here!

299
00:18:51,420 --> 00:18:52,960
Stinking scum!

300
00:19:04,560 --> 00:19:05,810
Zorthy!

301
00:19:05,890 --> 00:19:07,390
You bitch!

302
00:19:07,850 --> 00:19:12,350
Come on, you third-rate Gunmen!
Come at me all at once!

303
00:19:12,650 --> 00:19:15,110
I'll tear you limb
from limb!

304
00:19:15,320 --> 00:19:17,820
Come on, isn't this thing
working yet?!

305
00:19:17,940 --> 00:19:21,490
I'm trying, I'm trying!
How about now?

306
00:19:32,830 --> 00:19:34,130
What?!

307
00:19:42,630 --> 00:19:44,760
Impossible...
It broke my spine!

308
00:19:44,970 --> 00:19:47,680
- We got her!
- Yeah, got her!

309
00:19:47,760 --> 00:19:48,930
Now! Squash her!

310
00:19:49,020 --> 00:19:52,310
We'd like to, but we can't exactly
see where we're aiming!

311
00:19:52,440 --> 00:19:53,770
No.3 Bridge!

312
00:19:53,940 --> 00:19:56,400
- You've got her, you've got her!
- That's the way! Straight ahead!

313
00:19:57,150 --> 00:19:58,770
Look out ahead!

314
00:20:00,940 --> 00:20:02,700
What was that?
What happened?

315
00:20:04,700 --> 00:20:07,160
Enkidu!
Is that you, Viral?

316
00:20:07,450 --> 00:20:09,950
Forgive me for
disobeying orders, ma'am.

317
00:20:10,250 --> 00:20:12,620
But I have my own honor
to uphold!

318
00:20:19,630 --> 00:20:22,170
Not so fast.
I can't withdraw like this!

319
00:20:22,670 --> 00:20:25,510
You can continue the fight as long as
you are still alive, General Adiane!

320
00:20:25,890 --> 00:20:27,890
It's time for a strategic retreat.

321
00:20:29,060 --> 00:20:30,640
You!

322
00:20:30,970 --> 00:20:33,140
We're retreating for now,

323
00:20:33,350 --> 00:20:36,150
...but when next we meet,
we'll settle matters once and for all!

324
00:20:36,610 --> 00:20:38,110
What's he talking about?

325
00:20:40,650 --> 00:20:42,280
They're gone!
They bugged out!

326
00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:44,450
We did it!
We drove them off again!

327
00:20:44,860 --> 00:20:48,950
Goodness gracious... All this stress
is murder on my skin.

328
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:50,950
Are you okay, Nia?

329
00:20:51,040 --> 00:20:52,540
Yes, thank you.

330
00:20:52,830 --> 00:20:56,540
But I must apologize.
You were put in danger because of me.

331
00:20:56,630 --> 00:21:00,250
There's no need to thank us.
See? Look at that.

332
00:21:08,720 --> 00:21:10,600
Nia!

333
00:21:13,770 --> 00:21:16,270
They're all happy to see you
safe and sound.

334
00:21:17,850 --> 00:21:20,400
Thank you...
Thank you!

335
00:21:26,610 --> 00:21:29,410
You scum! Trash!
Vermin!

336
00:21:29,490 --> 00:21:32,580
What's the big idea,
leaving without a victory?!

337
00:21:32,830 --> 00:21:36,210
I can't return to the Capital
without my revenge!

338
00:21:36,580 --> 00:21:40,040
Who do you think I am,
you worthless piece of trash?!

339
00:21:44,090 --> 00:21:46,470
Well met,
my good pig-mole.

340
00:21:47,880 --> 00:21:49,180
Is Simon inside?

341
00:21:50,470 --> 00:21:53,760
Simon?
Simon, are you there?

342
00:21:54,430 --> 00:21:56,520
I brought you some dinner.

343
00:21:59,770 --> 00:22:04,360
Simon, everyone says they
are happy to see me safe.

344
00:22:04,440 --> 00:22:06,990
Even though I am their enemy...

345
00:22:07,110 --> 00:22:10,410
As I thought, the people
here are all very nice.

346
00:22:10,490 --> 00:22:12,700
But I know.

347
00:22:12,780 --> 00:22:18,870
I know that you were the first one
to run to my rescue, Simon.

348
00:22:20,380 --> 00:22:23,960
Simon, thank you.

349
00:22:25,630 --> 00:22:30,300
I can't do it...
I can never be like you, Bro...

350
00:22:31,090 --> 00:22:35,100
<font color=#000000>To Be Continued...</font>

351
00:22:42,250 --> 00:22:48,480
<font color=#FFFF00>Hikari wo motomete kage ha tawainai jooku wo shaberu
</font>'Cuz they seek light, the shadows chatter out grade-school jokes

352
00:22:48,480 --> 00:22:54,460
<font color=#FFFF00>Kikitai no ha sonna koto ja nai
</font>I don't want to listen to that crap

353
00:23:00,930 --> 00:23:06,990
<font color=#FFFF00>Taiyou motomete kage ha tamashii no nuketa koe kara
</font>'Cuz they seek the sun, the shadows suddenly change from

354
00:23:06,990 --> 00:23:12,870
<font color=#FFFF00>Kyuu ni surudoi kuchou ni kawaru
</font>The soul's missing voice to a sharp tone of voice

355
00:23:13,030 --> 00:23:19,580
<font color=#FFFF00>Sono oto ga machi no naka ni kodama-shite hibikinagara
</font>While that sound echoed and bounced in the middle of town,

356
00:23:19,580 --> 00:23:25,620
<font color=#FFFF00>Kemono no you na koe de sakebitsudzuketa
</font>I kept on screaming in a beastly voice

357
00:23:25,660 --> 00:23:28,890
<font color=#FFFF00>Kidou wo kaeta tsumori ha nai
</font>No way I'm going to change my course

358
00:23:28,890 --> 00:23:32,090
<font color=#FFFF00>Zankyou ha giratsuiteru ga
</font>The reverb's dazzling, but

359
00:23:32,090 --> 00:23:35,130
<font color=#FFFF00>Kussetsu-shite hanarete iku
</font>It refracts and comes apart

360
00:23:35,130 --> 00:23:39,260
<font color=#FFFF00>Koko no sekai ha itsumo kou da
</font>The world right here is always like this

361
00:23:46,180 --> 00:23:52,700
<font color=#FFFF00>Soto no sekai ni ha hikari ha aru no ka
</font>Is there light in the world outside?

362
00:24:05,610 --> 00:24:08,610
<b>Next Time</b>

363
00:24:06,730 --> 00:24:10,940
Inside people's hearts, there is
a deep, dark, frightening hole.

364
00:24:11,530 --> 00:24:14,280
This eventually becomes
a new tunnel.

365
00:24:15,240 --> 00:24:20,620
Next time on Gurren Lagann,
"Simon, Hands-Off".

366
