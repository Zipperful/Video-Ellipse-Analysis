00:00:10,670 --> 00:00:15,470
Gurren Lagann

2
00:00:15,470 --> 00:00:20,780
<font color=#FFFF00>Sugita kisetsu wo nageku hima ha nai
</font>I don't have the time to lament the seasons that have passed

3
00:00:20,780 --> 00:00:26,350
<font color=#FFFF00>Nido to mayotte shimawanu you ni
</font>So that I won't ever waver again

4
00:00:26,350 --> 00:00:31,660
<font color=#FFFF00>Kazoekirenai hon no sasayaka na
</font>With countless, tiny little

5
00:00:31,660 --> 00:00:36,560
<font color=#FFFF00>Sonna koukai kakaeta mama
</font>Regrets carried in my arms

6
00:00:36,660 --> 00:00:42,640
<font color=#FFFF00>Sono senaka dake oikakete koko made kitanda
</font>I've come this far, having chased only after your back

7
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:48,040
<font color=#FFFF00>Sagashite ita boku dake ni dekiru koto
</font>It's something only I, who sought you, can do

8
00:00:48,100 --> 00:00:53,110
<font color=#FFFF00>Ano hi kureta kotoba ga ima demo
</font>Those words you gave me that day, even now,

9
00:00:53,200 --> 00:00:58,940
<font color=#FFFF00>Kono mune ni tashika ni todoite iru kara
</font>Definitely reach my heart

10
00:00:59,050 --> 00:01:04,210
<font color=#FFFF00>Kinou yori mo kyou ha bu ha boku no
</font>I've realized my reason for having been born

11
00:01:04,250 --> 00:01:09,960
<font color=#FFFF00>Umarete kita wake ni kidzuite yuku
</font>Today more than I did yesterday

12
00:01:10,100 --> 00:01:18,830
<font color=#FFFF00>Kotae ha sou itsumo koko ni aru
</font>The answer, yes, is always right here

13
00:01:30,130 --> 00:01:34,090
<b>Seven years since the fall of Teppelin</b>

14
00:01:34,460 --> 00:01:39,640
<b>Kamina City, the New Capital
(Human capital built on its ruins)</b>

15
00:01:36,010 --> 00:01:40,640
With Lordgenome's defeat,
humanity was free to come up to the surface.

16
00:01:41,010 --> 00:01:44,640
What are Lagann, the Core Drill,
and Spiral Power?

17
00:01:45,060 --> 00:01:48,690
Why did Lordgenome try to drive
humanity underground?

18
00:01:49,060 --> 00:01:51,360
All those mysteries and more
remain unsolved.

19
00:01:53,270 --> 00:01:57,320
But we are intent on building
new lives for ourselves,

20
00:01:57,650 --> 00:02:01,820
...so we focus on tomorrow's hopes,
not yesterday's lingering questions.

21
00:02:03,160 --> 00:02:06,500
One of the few riddles we DID solve
is Old Coco's true identity.

22
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,410
Apparently, he was a Beastman created
to serve as Nia's butler,

23
00:02:09,710 --> 00:02:12,500
...and he had always
looked after her.

24
00:02:13,460 --> 00:02:17,510
Is it because we're at peace that we've
only solved such trivial mysteries?

25
00:02:19,380 --> 00:02:23,510
Yes, we have luxuriated in
this peace for seven years.

26
00:02:23,850 --> 00:02:26,640
Pretending all the while
not to notice...

27
00:02:26,770 --> 00:02:30,230
...Lordgenome's dying words gnawing
away at us from the inside.

28
00:02:42,820 --> 00:02:44,830
Come on, Rossiu,
have a heart!

29
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:48,000
These are all citizen complaints.
The sewers are backed up.

30
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:50,250
Taxes are too high.
The neighbors are too noisy.

31
00:02:50,830 --> 00:02:52,710
It's all self-centered nonsense.

32
00:02:52,920 --> 00:02:55,670
They've all completely forgotten
what life was like in the cellars.

33
00:02:56,340 --> 00:02:58,420
- I think that's great.
- But is it?

34
00:02:59,470 --> 00:03:01,260
Something bothering you?

35
00:03:01,340 --> 00:03:02,800
No, sir.

36
00:03:06,350 --> 00:03:07,560
Well met, you two!

37
00:03:07,640 --> 00:03:09,060
Nia! What brings you here?

38
00:03:09,140 --> 00:03:11,440
I made you some lunch!

39
00:03:15,190 --> 00:03:18,440
Oh, I'm sorry, Rossiu. I forgot
to make any for you!

40
00:03:18,780 --> 00:03:20,320
I'll rush out and
make something!

41
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:22,240
No, that's quite
all right.

42
00:03:22,410 --> 00:03:24,570
There is an Executive Council
meeting in 15 minutes.

43
00:03:24,700 --> 00:03:26,490
Please finish lunch by then,
all right?

44
00:03:31,370 --> 00:03:37,130
Episode 17:
You Don't Know Anything

45
00:03:48,390 --> 00:03:51,060
This is your Leeron,
Science Bureau Chief!

46
00:03:51,430 --> 00:03:54,900
Our moon probe Gunrocket
was launched successfully.

47
00:03:55,060 --> 00:03:56,940
It'll arrive at the moon
in one day.

48
00:03:57,150 --> 00:04:00,190
Understood.
Submit your report later.

49
00:04:00,280 --> 00:04:01,320
Will do!

50
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:03,610
This has been the one
and only Leeron! Ciao!

51
00:04:07,660 --> 00:04:11,370
Come on, do you really think you'll
find something on the moon, Simon?

52
00:04:11,500 --> 00:04:14,620
Address him as Supreme Commander,
Legal Affairs Bureau Chief Kittan.

53
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,460
Yeah, yeah...

54
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:19,590
One million apes...

55
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,590
When the land comes to overflow
with one million apes,

56
00:04:22,840 --> 00:04:26,590
...the moon shall become Hell's messenger
and destroy the world of the Spiral.

57
00:04:27,050 --> 00:04:30,010
Those were Lordgenome's
dying words.

58
00:04:31,980 --> 00:04:33,680
Thinking about it hasn't
gotten us anywhere.

59
00:04:33,770 --> 00:04:35,350
We have to go there
and see firsthand.

60
00:04:35,850 --> 00:04:38,020
If we don't find anything there,
no harm done.

61
00:04:38,110 --> 00:04:40,070
It's pretty amazing.

62
00:04:40,530 --> 00:04:44,030
Seven years ago, we didn't even
know the moon was a satellite,

63
00:04:44,360 --> 00:04:46,450
...and now we're capable
of sending probes there.

64
00:04:46,990 --> 00:04:50,700
Citizen Affairs Secretary Jorgun,
how is the census proceeding?

65
00:04:50,950 --> 00:04:52,660
Uh, about that...

66
00:04:52,950 --> 00:04:56,250
The "million apes" refers
to us human beings.

67
00:04:56,670 --> 00:05:01,550
It is vital that we determine when the
planet's population will reach one million.

68
00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:03,420
And we must do it
as soon as possible.

69
00:05:03,670 --> 00:05:08,640
Aw, don't talk like that. It's a mistake
to have these two count anything.

70
00:05:08,970 --> 00:05:13,100
No one is suggesting they do it themselves.
Use your organization to do it.

71
00:05:13,220 --> 00:05:17,100
Look, I'm just sayin' that these two
can't handle a delicate job like that.

72
00:05:17,310 --> 00:05:20,690
Then what are you people
still doing in the government?

73
00:05:20,770 --> 00:05:24,530
During every council meeting, all you do
is kick back and relax! Is that your job?!

74
00:05:24,780 --> 00:05:28,990
Those who said they couldn't handle the job
and left are better men by far than you!

75
00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:30,780
- Say what?
- What?!

76
00:05:30,870 --> 00:05:32,490
Give it a rest!

77
00:05:34,700 --> 00:05:38,290
Would if be all right if I issued orders
to the Citizen Affairs Bureau?

78
00:05:38,420 --> 00:05:39,620
Sure.

79
00:05:40,460 --> 00:05:44,460
Relax, you two. There won't be
any change in your status.

80
00:05:44,960 --> 00:05:48,720
Let's let Rossiu oversee this.
That's all.

81
00:05:53,310 --> 00:05:55,140
Who does he think he is?!

82
00:05:55,220 --> 00:05:57,980
We got somethin' to offer!
We got somethin' to offer, too!

83
00:06:00,520 --> 00:06:03,520
My goodness! Look at these two fine
notables of the New Government!

84
00:06:05,530 --> 00:06:07,780
No one eats
quite like you do!

85
00:06:07,860 --> 00:06:09,860
Please, feel free
to eat all you like!

86
00:06:09,950 --> 00:06:12,620
After all, Kamina and Simon,
the heroes of the revolution,

87
00:06:12,950 --> 00:06:16,950
...grew up eating my
pig-mole steaks!

88
00:06:17,330 --> 00:06:20,370
I raised those boys
as if they were my own!

89
00:06:25,460 --> 00:06:29,880
With him around, you wouldn't need to be
Kamina to want to get to the surface.

90
00:06:30,680 --> 00:06:32,890
What's the matter?
You look kinda bummed out.

91
00:06:36,430 --> 00:06:38,430
A million apes...

92
00:06:38,520 --> 00:06:40,690
The Spiral King was just
messing with our heads.

93
00:06:41,150 --> 00:06:43,440
You gotta take that with
a big grain of salt.

94
00:06:43,610 --> 00:06:47,610
Dumbass, Dayakka's worried
about his kid.

95
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:49,990
Oh, right.
It's about due.

96
00:06:50,200 --> 00:06:54,870
How can you be so relaxed, Kittan?
You're about to be an uncle, man.

97
00:06:54,990 --> 00:06:57,950
It just hasn't sunk in yet....

98
00:06:59,580 --> 00:07:04,380
Come try the pig-mole steak loved
by the heroic Gurren Lagann,

99
00:07:04,500 --> 00:07:08,210
<font color=#FFFF00>...it made Kamina and
Simon's mouths water!
</font>Hey, sis!
Does the laundry go over here?

100
00:07:08,210 --> 00:07:09,380
<font color=#FFFF00>...it made Kamina and
Simon's mouths water!
</font>That's fine.
Thanks.

101
00:07:09,380 --> 00:07:10,170
<font color=#FFFF00>Chief Shak's Steakhouse's pig-mole steaks
come straight from Giha Village!
</font>That's fine.
Thanks.

102
00:07:10,170 --> 00:07:12,630
<font color=#FFFF00>Chief Shak's Steakhouse's pig-mole steaks
come straight from Giha Village!</font>

103
00:07:12,640 --> 00:07:13,640
<font color=#FFFF00>Chief Shak's Steakhouse's pig-mole steaks
come straight from Giha Village!
</font>Coming!

104
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:14,180
I've got it!
You sit down, sis.

105
00:07:14,180 --> 00:07:16,350
<font color=#FFFF00>I'll throw one on the
grill just for you!
</font>I've got it!
You sit down, sis.

106
00:07:22,850 --> 00:07:24,520
- He proposed?!
- He proposed?!

107
00:07:25,110 --> 00:07:25,940
Yes.

108
00:07:26,020 --> 00:07:29,990
Well, well. Simon finally
took the plunge, did he?

109
00:07:30,110 --> 00:07:32,200
That's why I was hoping
to get your advice.

110
00:07:32,320 --> 00:07:34,030
Tell us! What did he say?

111
00:07:34,370 --> 00:07:35,990
I have to know!

112
00:07:45,670 --> 00:07:47,630
It's beautiful, isn't it?

113
00:07:47,880 --> 00:07:49,750
This city.

114
00:07:51,470 --> 00:07:52,340
Yes.

115
00:07:52,470 --> 00:07:55,800
Everyone is living happy lives
under the sun.

116
00:07:55,890 --> 00:07:57,350
You're right.

117
00:07:59,560 --> 00:08:02,060
Maybe the time is
finally right to get out.

118
00:08:04,190 --> 00:08:07,020
To be regular people, not a princess
or the leader of Team Gurren.

119
00:08:07,400 --> 00:08:11,610
To see the same things, hear the
same sounds, and to laugh together.

120
00:08:12,110 --> 00:08:14,950
Maybe it might be nice to
have that kind of life now.

121
00:08:16,030 --> 00:08:19,780
My eyes would be your eyes,
and your ears would be my ears.

122
00:08:20,040 --> 00:08:22,950
Maybe something like that
would be nice.

123
00:08:24,580 --> 00:08:26,370
What's this?

124
00:08:27,960 --> 00:08:30,300
Let's get married, Nia.

125
00:08:38,100 --> 00:08:39,470
No way!

126
00:08:40,680 --> 00:08:41,890
You turned him down?!

127
00:08:42,230 --> 00:08:43,180
Yes.

128
00:08:43,480 --> 00:08:45,440
Why did you turn
him down?!

129
00:08:46,980 --> 00:08:51,150
Well, I thought that maybe two people
couldn't really become the same person.

130
00:08:52,860 --> 00:08:54,150
Um...

131
00:08:54,450 --> 00:08:58,320
Well, that's true, but, well, that's
basically what married couples are.

132
00:08:58,450 --> 00:09:01,280
Anyway, he only meant it
as a figure of speech!

133
00:09:01,450 --> 00:09:03,200
Sis! Be careful with the baby!

134
00:09:03,290 --> 00:09:07,920
Simon, that boy who's only good at digging
tunnels and fighting in Gurren Lagann...

135
00:09:08,130 --> 00:09:10,590
...spent seven years trying
to get those words out!

136
00:09:10,920 --> 00:09:14,260
How about you?
How did they make you feel?

137
00:09:14,630 --> 00:09:16,680
How did I feel?

138
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:21,470
Yes! It isn't the meaning of the words that's
important, it's how they made you feel!

139
00:09:31,820 --> 00:09:33,280
Looks like we have
an answer.

140
00:09:33,400 --> 00:09:36,240
You're the same old naive,
pampered princess as ever...

141
00:09:36,360 --> 00:09:40,030
Well, I'd say that's
what makes Nia Nia.

142
00:09:42,120 --> 00:09:43,910
It's the woman's turn
this time.

143
00:09:44,040 --> 00:09:47,620
Don't tell him in words,
tell him how you feel.

144
00:09:54,630 --> 00:09:55,800
It's huge!

145
00:09:55,880 --> 00:09:58,090
Well, it's the Kamina City
monument, after all.

146
00:09:59,680 --> 00:10:01,680
He would have appreciated
the overkill of it.

147
00:10:03,430 --> 00:10:04,890
Yoko!

148
00:10:08,560 --> 00:10:10,100
We can't talk you out
of going?

149
00:10:10,150 --> 00:10:14,900
Nah... I'm not cut out for all this
council and politics stuff.

150
00:10:15,070 --> 00:10:18,360
That's not true! I'm sure you would do
just fine if you set your mind to it!

151
00:10:18,450 --> 00:10:21,820
No, no. You guys
can do it.

152
00:10:21,950 --> 00:10:23,530
See ya.

153
00:10:25,080 --> 00:10:28,870
You better keep Nia safe. You hear,
Supreme Commander Simon?

154
00:10:41,720 --> 00:10:46,140
That pampered princess isn't going
to deign to let me protect her.

155
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:49,480
Hello?

156
00:10:50,230 --> 00:10:51,440
Nia?

157
00:10:52,810 --> 00:10:57,070
Um... I think you and I
are different people.

158
00:10:57,230 --> 00:10:59,610
Very, very different people.

159
00:10:59,700 --> 00:11:04,120
But since we're the same in being different,
I think living together would work out.

160
00:11:04,830 --> 00:11:08,240
Thank you for this ring.
I really like it.

161
00:11:12,960 --> 00:11:13,710
Yeah!

162
00:11:14,960 --> 00:11:18,000
I did it!
Bro, I did it!

163
00:11:18,510 --> 00:11:20,300
You seem awfully happy.

164
00:11:21,430 --> 00:11:22,430
Supreme Commander.

165
00:11:22,550 --> 00:11:24,930
A-Ah, Rossiu.
What can I do for you?

166
00:11:25,010 --> 00:11:28,430
There's been an attack by anti-government
guerillas in southern Henpeena Sector.

167
00:11:28,600 --> 00:11:29,140
What?!

168
00:11:29,270 --> 00:11:33,520
The Grapearl Squadron has already been
scrambled, but you should see this.

169
00:11:36,440 --> 00:11:37,480
Viral?

170
00:11:37,690 --> 00:11:39,610
Okay, I'll join them
in Gurren Lagann!

171
00:11:39,780 --> 00:11:43,070
No. You are Supreme Commander
of the New Government.

172
00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:45,620
It is not your job
to go into combat.

173
00:11:45,950 --> 00:11:48,950
That's Viral out there!
If I don't settle things with him, he'll--

174
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:52,540
Please focus on doing your own job!
Supreme Commander Simon!

175
00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:19,520
You cheap Gurren Lagann knock-offs
are no match for me!

176
00:12:19,780 --> 00:12:21,280
Where is Simon?!

177
00:12:21,570 --> 00:12:24,240
The Supreme Commander
isn't gonna dirty his hands with you!

178
00:12:27,700 --> 00:12:29,120
Gimmy, be careful!

179
00:12:29,240 --> 00:12:32,370
Your shooting's as sharp as ever!
Thanks for the save, Darry!

180
00:12:35,370 --> 00:12:36,370
Viral!

181
00:12:39,920 --> 00:12:42,010
My shield!
It won't hold...?!

182
00:12:49,010 --> 00:12:51,890
You're screaming,
aren't you, Enkidudu?

183
00:12:52,020 --> 00:12:54,230
Hang in there for just
a little longer!

184
00:13:03,820 --> 00:13:05,450
You're down for good, huh?

185
00:13:06,280 --> 00:13:11,030
Thanks for putting up with my selfish
demands on you for so long. I'm sorry.

186
00:13:21,590 --> 00:13:22,880
Viral.

187
00:13:23,510 --> 00:13:25,010
What's with that look?

188
00:13:25,090 --> 00:13:27,090
You are one persistent guy.

189
00:13:27,220 --> 00:13:30,890
Why do you insist on opposing us?
The war is over.

190
00:13:31,640 --> 00:13:35,480
I don't want to hear that from the man
who's taken over Teppelin's throne.

191
00:13:35,680 --> 00:13:36,730
What's that supposed
to mean?

192
00:13:37,230 --> 00:13:40,440
Look at that. I was trying
to protect them.

193
00:13:40,560 --> 00:13:42,610
- They're humans?
- That's right.

194
00:13:42,690 --> 00:13:45,440
They told me that they wanted
to live underground.

195
00:13:45,530 --> 00:13:48,570
There are some humans
who feel that way.

196
00:13:48,700 --> 00:13:52,410
They believe that their true
home lies underground.

197
00:13:52,870 --> 00:13:55,450
That's why I decided
to assist them.

198
00:13:55,750 --> 00:13:57,910
The only difference is where
they're forced to live.

199
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,630
Isn't what you're doing exactly the
same as what the Spiral King did?

200
00:14:01,340 --> 00:14:03,170
Right, Simon?

201
00:14:05,210 --> 00:14:09,340
Stop this self-justification. Anti-government
activities will be punished in a court of law.

202
00:14:09,510 --> 00:14:11,430
You will have your say
at your trial.

203
00:14:11,550 --> 00:14:13,760
My "trial"?
What's that?

204
00:14:13,930 --> 00:14:16,850
A new piece of wisdom
that humanity has acquired.

205
00:14:17,560 --> 00:14:19,730
Gimmy, take him away.

206
00:14:22,730 --> 00:14:25,730
Rossiu. Why didn't you
tell me about this?

207
00:14:26,650 --> 00:14:29,280
Did I issue any orders to find
and drag to the surface...

208
00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:31,990
...people who want to
live underground?

209
00:14:32,620 --> 00:14:35,160
You mustn't rise
to Viral's bait.

210
00:14:35,450 --> 00:14:38,290
He's a holdout of
Lordgenome's old order.

211
00:14:38,750 --> 00:14:41,710
Then is what he said
a lie?

212
00:14:41,790 --> 00:14:43,710
No, it's the truth.

213
00:14:43,840 --> 00:14:46,590
- Why, then?!
- It is for population verification.

214
00:14:46,880 --> 00:14:51,760
If people live out of sight, we won't be
able to maintain an accurate census.

215
00:14:52,260 --> 00:14:54,470
They could bring us over one million
without our knowing.

216
00:14:54,760 --> 00:14:57,350
It is the government's responsibility
to prevent that!

217
00:14:58,680 --> 00:15:00,270
If you will excuse me.

218
00:15:00,640 --> 00:15:02,600
What would you
do then?!

219
00:15:02,730 --> 00:15:06,690
If you found a millionth person,
would you exile him from the planet?!

220
00:15:07,320 --> 00:15:11,110
That would be no different than what
went on back in Adai village!

221
00:15:13,240 --> 00:15:15,950
You understand NOTHING.

222
00:15:22,580 --> 00:15:26,130
Chief Advisor, we've been contacted
by the Spiral Power Research Institute.

223
00:15:26,420 --> 00:15:29,130
Apparently, they were successful
in activating the bio-computer.

224
00:15:29,510 --> 00:15:31,930
- I see.
- Congratulations, sir.

225
00:15:32,050 --> 00:15:35,090
Your dream is finally
about to come true.

226
00:15:35,220 --> 00:15:38,680
Yes. With this, we will be able
to learn this world's secrets.

227
00:15:38,970 --> 00:15:43,390
Commander Simon, the council, the
citizens, they've all grown complacent!

228
00:15:43,980 --> 00:15:46,650
You are the only thing keeping the
government running, Chief Advisor.

229
00:15:49,030 --> 00:15:50,740
It's not just me.

230
00:15:51,030 --> 00:15:53,400
There is also you,
the younger generation.

231
00:16:07,590 --> 00:16:11,090
<font color=#FFC9B9>Gurren Lagann</font>

232
00:16:12,590 --> 00:16:16,090
<font color=#FFC9B9>Gurren Lagann</font>

233
00:16:23,140 --> 00:16:24,520
Boota!

234
00:16:24,980 --> 00:16:28,400
That's a good boy. You're one thing
that never changes around here.

235
00:16:35,160 --> 00:16:36,320
Hello?

236
00:16:36,780 --> 00:16:39,160
Kiyoh had her baby?!

237
00:16:40,040 --> 00:16:42,950
That's right! A girl!
It's a girl!

238
00:16:43,040 --> 00:16:48,040
Her name is Anne. It seems Dayakka had
been giving it some thought for a long time.

239
00:16:48,250 --> 00:16:49,590
Sure.

240
00:16:52,300 --> 00:16:54,720
That's wonderful.

241
00:16:56,220 --> 00:16:59,850
I'll stop by the hospital later.
It's fine.

242
00:17:19,700 --> 00:17:20,830
What's that?!

243
00:17:22,330 --> 00:17:24,250
I'm sorry, Nia,
I'll call back later!

244
00:17:24,330 --> 00:17:26,660
Hello? Simon?
Simon?

245
00:17:37,890 --> 00:17:39,390
Huh? What's this?

246
00:17:55,190 --> 00:17:56,440
Nia!

247
00:17:57,490 --> 00:17:58,780
Huh?

248
00:17:59,200 --> 00:17:59,910
Nia?

249
00:18:02,910 --> 00:18:05,120
You didn't detect
the enemy's approach?

250
00:18:05,370 --> 00:18:07,960
It appeared without warning
over Kamina City!

251
00:18:08,080 --> 00:18:10,080
Almost as if it tore
a hole in the sky!

252
00:18:10,210 --> 00:18:11,380
Grapearl Squadron status?

253
00:18:12,210 --> 00:18:14,880
- Already launched!
- We'll engage the enemy momentarily.

254
00:18:16,550 --> 00:18:19,380
It hasn't got a face...
I've never seen a mecha like this before.

255
00:18:19,510 --> 00:18:21,340
Some new anti-government
guerilla weapon?

256
00:18:21,760 --> 00:18:25,390
We are currently running a match
on the enemy machine's model.

257
00:18:25,520 --> 00:18:27,640
Grapearl Squadron, prevent the
destruction of the city.

258
00:18:27,730 --> 00:18:28,560
- Roger that!
- Roger!

259
00:18:28,690 --> 00:18:31,310
All units, scatter! Attack simultaneously
from all directions!

260
00:18:36,490 --> 00:18:38,150
- It absorbed them?
- I can't believe it...

261
00:18:38,280 --> 00:18:41,660
In that case,
Grapearl Blade!

262
00:18:51,080 --> 00:18:52,830
Contact lost with
Korza's Grapearl.

263
00:18:53,210 --> 00:18:55,380
Handguns and blades
have no effect?

264
00:18:55,500 --> 00:18:57,550
What're you doing, Rossiu?!

265
00:19:06,470 --> 00:19:07,310
Gimmy!

266
00:19:07,770 --> 00:19:09,640
I'm okay!
It's still working!

267
00:19:09,770 --> 00:19:12,400
But we're down to just two
functioning units now...

268
00:19:14,570 --> 00:19:15,820
Damn, it's tough...

269
00:19:16,570 --> 00:19:18,070
If only we had our Gunmen...

270
00:19:18,150 --> 00:19:20,610
...that thing would be a pushover!

271
00:19:20,950 --> 00:19:23,240
Gunmen are relics of
the Spiral King's time.

272
00:19:23,320 --> 00:19:26,330
They didn't fit in with the new era,
so we disposed of all of them.

273
00:19:26,700 --> 00:19:29,000
The Grapearls are mass-produced,
combat-specialized units...

274
00:19:29,290 --> 00:19:31,290
...based on our
Gurren Lagann research.

275
00:19:31,540 --> 00:19:33,620
If the Grapearls are
no match for it,

276
00:19:33,710 --> 00:19:36,250
...your old Gunmen couldn't
so much as scratch it.

277
00:19:37,300 --> 00:19:41,010
Kinon? Um, your personality
has done a 180...

278
00:19:45,510 --> 00:19:47,310
Darry! Don't be crazy!

279
00:19:48,470 --> 00:19:50,310
I can still fight!

280
00:19:53,650 --> 00:19:54,600
Darry!

281
00:20:00,990 --> 00:20:02,450
Gurren Lagann...

282
00:20:04,530 --> 00:20:06,200
We've been waiting
for ya, Simon!

283
00:20:06,280 --> 00:20:07,910
It's too dangerous, Commander!

284
00:20:08,120 --> 00:20:11,080
It is not your job to go out
and fight on the front lines!

285
00:20:11,330 --> 00:20:13,290
How many times
do I have to tell you?!

286
00:20:13,420 --> 00:20:14,870
Dumbass!

287
00:20:16,130 --> 00:20:20,760
Protecting the city and the lives of
the citizens! THAT is our #1 job!

288
00:20:21,220 --> 00:20:22,840
Has all this peace made
you soft, Rossiu?

289
00:20:22,930 --> 00:20:24,260
But, sir--

290
00:20:24,590 --> 00:20:26,680
Yeah, this is the one place
I can really be me.

291
00:20:28,890 --> 00:20:31,810
Let's go,
you faceless bastard!

292
00:20:32,730 --> 00:20:37,980
- GIGA DRILL BREAK!
- Why must you keep taking the easy way?

293
00:20:38,570 --> 00:20:40,070
Is that model analysis
done yet?!

294
00:20:40,320 --> 00:20:44,400
Team Dai-Gurren Resistance, Lordgenome
Army, New Government units...

295
00:20:44,700 --> 00:20:46,700
There are no matches in
any of our databases!

296
00:20:46,820 --> 00:20:49,120
Then where in the world
did it come from?

297
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:51,660
Commander! Give top priority
to identification!

298
00:20:51,750 --> 00:20:53,790
- It didn't work!
- If possible, capture it!

299
00:20:55,250 --> 00:20:57,750
Quit bugging me!
Like I have time to do that!

300
00:20:57,830 --> 00:21:01,300
- Simon!
- Your drill, it's building up energy?

301
00:21:03,170 --> 00:21:06,430
Here goes! I'm sick of you
and your light show!

302
00:21:07,010 --> 00:21:12,600
I'm gonna take this crappy beam of yours
and shove it down your throat!

303
00:21:21,150 --> 00:21:23,440
- Awesome!
- Did he do it?

304
00:21:38,580 --> 00:21:39,630
No way...!

305
00:21:40,090 --> 00:21:41,380
The city!

306
00:21:42,960 --> 00:21:47,090
Dispatch fire and rescue crews to the city!
Keep the fire damage to a minimum!

307
00:21:47,380 --> 00:21:50,050
What the hell
just happened?

308
00:21:50,510 --> 00:21:53,930
He didn't know what it was, and yet he
charged in and counterattacked blindly,

309
00:21:54,020 --> 00:21:55,730
...and he destroyed
the whole thing!

310
00:21:55,930 --> 00:21:59,520
"Rash" doesn't even begin to describe
the Supreme Commander's actions!

311
00:22:02,730 --> 00:22:03,610
Nia?

312
00:22:08,160 --> 00:22:10,490
Is that Nia?

313
00:22:12,870 --> 00:22:14,950
Attention, humans of Earth.

314
00:22:15,250 --> 00:22:19,290
We Anti-Spiral races have
determined that humanity...

315
00:22:19,580 --> 00:22:24,800
...has achieved Spiral Power
danger level two.

316
00:22:25,760 --> 00:22:29,930
We hereby activate the
Humanity Extermination System.

317
00:22:31,140 --> 00:22:35,140
To Be Continued...
