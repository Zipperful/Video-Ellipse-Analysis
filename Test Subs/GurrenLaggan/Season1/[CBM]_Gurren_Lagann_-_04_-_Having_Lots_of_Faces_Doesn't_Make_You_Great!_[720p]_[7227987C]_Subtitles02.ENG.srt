1
00:00:10,670 --> 00:00:15,510
Gurren Lagann

2
00:00:15,580 --> 00:00:18,110
<font color=#FFFF00>Kimi ha kikoeru?
</font>Can you hear it?

3
00:00:18,250 --> 00:00:26,250
<font color=#FFFF00>Boku no kono koe ga yami ni munashiku suikomareta
</font>This voice of mine was sucked emptily into darkness

4
00:00:26,600 --> 00:00:31,700
<font color=#FFFF00>Moshimo sekai ga imi wo motsu no nara
</font>If the world has meaning to it,

5
00:00:32,030 --> 00:00:36,570
<font color=#FFFF00>Konna kimochi mo muda de ha nai
</font>Then these kinds of feelings aren't futile

6
00:00:36,910 --> 00:00:42,610
<font color=#FFFF00>Akogare ni oshitsubusarete akirametetanda
</font>I was crushed by my longing and had given up

7
00:00:42,910 --> 00:00:47,870
<font color=#FFFF00>Hateshinai sora no iro mo shiranaide
</font>Without even knowing the color of the endless sky

8
00:00:48,280 --> 00:00:53,190
<font color=#FFFF00>Hashiridashita omoi ga ima demo
</font>I began to run, because my feelings, even now,

9
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:58,960
<font color=#FFFF00>Kono mune wo tashika ni tataiteru kara
</font>Are definitely beating against my heart

10
00:00:59,230 --> 00:01:04,030
<font color=#FFFF00>Kyou no boku ga sono saki ni tsudzuku
</font>The me of today will continue towards our destination

11
00:01:04,500 --> 00:01:10,060
<font color=#FFFF00>Bokura nari no asu wo kizuite yuku
</font>We'll amass our own tomorrows

12
00:01:10,410 --> 00:01:18,900
<font color=#FFFF00>Kotae ha sou itsumo koko ni aru
</font>The answer, yes, is always right here

13
00:01:37,880 --> 00:01:43,350
This is the tale of a man who has yet
to realize what his destiny is.

14
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:48,440
With a feeling of relief, Simon and Kamina
finally reach the village of Littner.

15
00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:51,020
What they found awaiting
them there was Viral,

16
00:01:51,110 --> 00:01:53,900
...a Beastman who piloted
a powerful Gunmen.

17
00:01:54,480 --> 00:01:56,900
Simon leapt into the fray to assist
Kamina in his moment of peril.

18
00:01:57,200 --> 00:01:59,820
In the course of this
fierce battle,

19
00:01:59,950 --> 00:02:02,780
...their two Gunmen, Gurren
and Lagann, combined!

20
00:02:03,160 --> 00:02:07,040
Gurren Lagann's drill sent
Viral's Gunmen, Enki, flying.

21
00:02:07,250 --> 00:02:11,880
What unknown power lies concealed
within Gurren Lagann?

22
00:02:12,340 --> 00:02:18,050
Episode 4:
Having Lots of Faces Doesn't Make You Great!

23
00:02:25,640 --> 00:02:27,270
I'm starving...

24
00:02:32,650 --> 00:02:36,280
I wonder how far away the
Beastmen headquarters is.

25
00:02:46,580 --> 00:02:48,160
Special training?

26
00:02:48,330 --> 00:02:51,170
Think back, Simon!
To our combining! Our combining!

27
00:02:56,130 --> 00:02:59,130
That was so lame I'm embarrassed
to think about it.

28
00:03:00,550 --> 00:03:05,390
Listen, Simon, a manly combining
ought to be more... beautiful!

29
00:03:05,470 --> 00:03:08,770
The act of souls that
are a raging inferno!

30
00:03:08,850 --> 00:03:11,350
- Yeah, that was pretty bad.
- Simon!

31
00:03:11,810 --> 00:03:13,810
Jump onto my shoulders!

32
00:03:16,190 --> 00:03:19,940
It's pointless to do that
outside our mechas!

33
00:03:20,570 --> 00:03:22,200
Right, Boota?

34
00:03:22,530 --> 00:03:24,160
Simon, c'mon!

35
00:03:27,740 --> 00:03:29,540
Watch what you're doing!

36
00:03:30,460 --> 00:03:31,870
Simon!

37
00:03:32,710 --> 00:03:33,830
What?

38
00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:35,210
Combine!

39
00:03:35,710 --> 00:03:37,710
How am I supposed
to do that?

40
00:03:37,750 --> 00:03:39,500
Combine!

41
00:03:42,800 --> 00:03:44,970
Those two seem to be
enjoying themselves.

42
00:03:49,140 --> 00:03:50,140
Really?

43
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:52,310
What did you want
to check up on?

44
00:03:52,440 --> 00:03:55,520
Watch this.
Now, then...

45
00:03:56,060 --> 00:03:59,610
First we pull on the gloves,

46
00:03:59,690 --> 00:04:03,070
..and now it's time to
do your thing, loves!

47
00:04:03,950 --> 00:04:06,950
You brought THOSE along?
You and your creepy toys...

48
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:09,700
There's no call to be rude, missy.

49
00:04:11,370 --> 00:04:14,250
Attaboy, attaboy, you can do it,
way to go!

50
00:04:14,370 --> 00:04:18,750
Attaboy, attaboy, you can do it,
way to go!

51
00:04:22,090 --> 00:04:23,470
Just as I thought.

52
00:04:23,590 --> 00:04:28,260
I've seen all sorts of Gunmen over
the years, but nothing like this.

53
00:04:28,760 --> 00:04:30,930
What do you mean?

54
00:04:31,220 --> 00:04:35,310
It's still just a theory at this point,
but if what I'm thinking is correct...

55
00:04:36,230 --> 00:04:38,310
...this Gunmen is special.

56
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:46,860
Oops, sorry about that!
It got away from me!

57
00:04:47,320 --> 00:04:49,530
Hey, Simon!
You okay?

58
00:04:50,330 --> 00:04:51,700
Ready for more?

59
00:04:53,660 --> 00:04:57,040
- I'm real sorry 'bout that.
- My poor little mechie...

60
00:04:57,130 --> 00:04:59,960
Whew, lucky thing
I didn't hit Lagann!

61
00:05:00,090 --> 00:05:01,960
Okay, Simon!
Get ready for round two!

62
00:05:02,090 --> 00:05:04,800
- That one was my favorite!
- You can always rebuild it.

63
00:05:07,760 --> 00:05:09,550
Now, combine!

64
00:05:11,390 --> 00:05:14,390
C'mon, Bro, cut it out!

65
00:05:16,310 --> 00:05:19,400
Simon!
Quit your running!

66
00:05:20,230 --> 00:05:24,280
Combine!
Combine, damn you!

67
00:05:24,690 --> 00:05:28,240
You're not making any sense!
You're gonna kill me!

68
00:05:30,780 --> 00:05:32,780
What are those people doing?

69
00:05:32,870 --> 00:05:35,160
Simon! Combine!

70
00:05:35,290 --> 00:05:37,910
Cut it out, Bro!

71
00:05:40,170 --> 00:05:42,840
Okay, let's get in there!

72
00:05:47,800 --> 00:05:53,510
Bro, I'm running on fumes!
I can't run anymore...

73
00:05:53,930 --> 00:05:55,640
Damn it, Simon!

74
00:05:55,730 --> 00:06:00,020
For a real man, a growling stomach
is no match for his fighting spirit!

75
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:03,480
Mine's growling too, huh?

76
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:06,150
I'm starving...

77
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:10,490
Bro?

78
00:06:15,620 --> 00:06:17,200
What the hell?!

79
00:06:18,920 --> 00:06:20,040
Bro!

80
00:06:24,420 --> 00:06:25,920
Hello, little boy!

81
00:06:27,130 --> 00:06:28,380
He's so cute!

82
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:31,390
You had a close call,
but you're safe now!

83
00:06:36,140 --> 00:06:37,890
What's the big idea?

84
00:06:40,520 --> 00:06:41,980
A-A woman?

85
00:06:42,060 --> 00:06:43,730
I bet you were scared!

86
00:06:46,900 --> 00:06:48,690
Son of a bitch!

87
00:06:48,990 --> 00:06:50,650
On your feet, Gurren!

88
00:06:53,320 --> 00:06:57,120
At times like this, you gotta smack
machines to get 'em to work!

89
00:07:09,510 --> 00:07:11,550
Crap!

90
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:17,140
Prepare to die,
you Beastman bastard!

91
00:07:17,180 --> 00:07:20,890
What? Beastman?
Are you kidding me?

92
00:07:22,150 --> 00:07:24,100
Ow...

93
00:07:25,820 --> 00:07:27,770
You're a human?

94
00:07:28,230 --> 00:07:30,070
That's pretty damn obvious!

95
00:07:33,530 --> 00:07:34,950
Who the hell are you?

96
00:07:35,070 --> 00:07:36,450
Bro!

97
00:07:38,490 --> 00:07:42,330
You weren't being chased?

98
00:07:46,040 --> 00:07:48,500
You do a pretty good impersonation
of a human.

99
00:07:48,630 --> 00:07:51,760
Hey, if you don't watch your mouth,
I'm gonna kill you for real!

100
00:07:51,880 --> 00:07:53,510
Let's see those pearly whites.

101
00:07:55,090 --> 00:07:57,970
Well, I'll be...
You don't have fangs.

102
00:07:58,140 --> 00:08:02,020
Even so, how are you gonna
reimburse me for all this, huh?!

103
00:08:02,190 --> 00:08:03,390
Who throws bombs at people?

104
00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:05,400
- Reimburse you?
- Look at this mess! How were you raised?

105
00:08:05,480 --> 00:08:08,900
Anyway, what the hell is
a human doing in a Gunmen?

106
00:08:09,190 --> 00:08:12,360
Everybody knows that Beastmen
pilot Gunmen.

107
00:08:12,490 --> 00:08:13,400
So they say.

108
00:08:13,490 --> 00:08:15,450
So I say!

109
00:08:15,530 --> 00:08:18,620
Well, the reason for that is...
'CAUSE I STOLE IT, THAT'S WHY!

110
00:08:18,700 --> 00:08:19,700
You liar!

111
00:08:19,790 --> 00:08:21,160
I pilot it!

112
00:08:21,790 --> 00:08:23,160
That ain't possible!

113
00:08:23,370 --> 00:08:25,370
Who the hell do you
think I am?

114
00:08:27,880 --> 00:08:31,840
Beyond the furthest horizon,
I crawled up from Giha Village!

115
00:08:31,920 --> 00:08:35,550
I have defeated as many Gunmen
as there are stars in the sky!

116
00:08:36,470 --> 00:08:39,760
When you hear about Kamina,
the badass leader of Team Gurren,

117
00:08:39,850 --> 00:08:41,850
...it is me they speak of!

118
00:08:41,970 --> 00:08:43,390
- Wonderful...
- He's cute!

119
00:08:45,810 --> 00:08:47,350
Kamina!

120
00:08:48,690 --> 00:08:50,150
Oh, Kamina!

121
00:08:50,860 --> 00:08:52,030
You're so cool!

122
00:08:52,110 --> 00:08:53,490
I think you're wonderful...

123
00:08:53,610 --> 00:08:55,200
You're so debonair!

124
00:08:55,610 --> 00:08:57,860
I'm Kiyoh, the oldest sister.

125
00:08:58,200 --> 00:09:01,200
Um, I'm Kinon, the middle sister.

126
00:09:01,830 --> 00:09:04,500
I'm Kiyal, the youngest!

127
00:09:05,160 --> 00:09:07,000
And this is our big brother---

128
00:09:07,080 --> 00:09:08,000
Kittan.

129
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:09,380
You've met.

130
00:09:09,460 --> 00:09:13,130
That's right!
We're Beastmen hunters!

131
00:09:13,550 --> 00:09:15,420
The Black Siblings!

132
00:09:16,930 --> 00:09:21,720
We, um, use this burning water to,
uh, destroy Gunmen.

133
00:09:21,970 --> 00:09:23,600
Oh, that's what these
black things are?

134
00:09:23,640 --> 00:09:26,770
That's right, it's scary stuff, man!
It'll blow you up real good!

135
00:09:27,230 --> 00:09:28,900
Knock on wood, huh?

136
00:09:29,480 --> 00:09:33,860
Kiyoh! Kinon! Kiyal!
Get away from him!

137
00:09:34,940 --> 00:09:38,110
He and I have something
to settle with our fists.

138
00:09:38,780 --> 00:09:42,410
Your attention, please!
Playtime is over, children.

139
00:09:46,460 --> 00:09:49,960
<font color=#FFC9B9>Gurren Lagann</font>

140
00:09:51,460 --> 00:09:54,960
<font color=#FFC9B9>Gurren Lagann</font>

141
00:09:57,340 --> 00:10:02,010
Why do WE have to go out
and find lunch for everyone?

142
00:10:02,100 --> 00:10:06,020
It means that hungry men
are absolutely useless.

143
00:10:06,730 --> 00:10:10,810
You're so lucky, Yoko! You get to
travel with such a great man!

144
00:10:10,900 --> 00:10:12,980
What's so "great"
about that bozo?

145
00:10:13,070 --> 00:10:14,730
Well, he certainly has
a booming voice.

146
00:10:15,280 --> 00:10:16,900
He looks tough...

147
00:10:17,700 --> 00:10:19,650
Yeah, and his feet
don't reek.

148
00:10:19,990 --> 00:10:22,780
And did you see those
long eyelashes of his?

149
00:10:22,910 --> 00:10:23,910
Yeah!

150
00:10:29,870 --> 00:10:33,590
Look, a watering hole!
Where there's water, there's animals!

151
00:10:36,960 --> 00:10:40,800
Hey, check this out! There's a
cool one on the ground over here!

152
00:10:43,220 --> 00:10:44,850
It looks delicious!

153
00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:50,310
You're traveling to the
Beastmen's headquarters?

154
00:10:50,440 --> 00:10:53,520
What's a bunch of rank amateurs
like you gonna do about 'em?

155
00:10:53,610 --> 00:10:55,190
You're just scared.

156
00:10:55,320 --> 00:10:58,780
I ain't scared of nothin'! I'm sayin' that
you shouldn't underestimate Beastmen!

157
00:11:00,740 --> 00:11:02,570
I'm starving...

158
00:11:02,660 --> 00:11:04,120
You, too?

159
00:11:04,200 --> 00:11:07,580
We've been tracking a Gunmen
with 16 faces since this morning,

160
00:11:07,700 --> 00:11:10,080
...and haven't had
time to eat.

161
00:11:10,460 --> 00:11:12,580
With 16 faces?

162
00:11:13,380 --> 00:11:17,090
There's no such thing!
You sure you weren't hallucinating?

163
00:11:17,170 --> 00:11:20,340
What, you've never
seen one with 16 faces?

164
00:11:20,470 --> 00:11:21,470
Wha--?

165
00:11:22,590 --> 00:11:24,590
I'm so hungry...

166
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:28,600
When you're hungry, it's hard to work up
the energy to do anything, right, Simon?

167
00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:29,470
Yeah...

168
00:11:29,930 --> 00:11:31,480
That cloud looks tasty!

169
00:11:31,690 --> 00:11:33,230
That meat cloud is mine!

170
00:11:33,310 --> 00:11:35,360
I saw it first, so I have dibs!

171
00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:37,360
You wanna start somethin', jack?

172
00:11:38,070 --> 00:11:40,530
What are you boys getting
so worked up over?

173
00:11:40,650 --> 00:11:42,900
- Look what we found!
- Doesn't this look delicious?

174
00:11:42,990 --> 00:11:44,490
Doesn't it?

175
00:11:46,450 --> 00:11:48,790
Uh, is this edible?

176
00:11:48,870 --> 00:11:51,710
You can eat anything as long
as it's not rotten, right?

177
00:11:51,790 --> 00:11:53,210
Let's dig in!

178
00:11:57,590 --> 00:11:59,920
Did you just bite me?!

179
00:12:01,010 --> 00:12:02,340
Our lunch just talked!

180
00:12:02,470 --> 00:12:05,760
Bro, take a close look
at their stupid mugs!

181
00:12:07,220 --> 00:12:08,850
Hey, these guys is humans!

182
00:12:08,930 --> 00:12:09,850
They're so cute!

183
00:12:09,970 --> 00:12:13,140
Our siesta's been interrupted!

184
00:12:13,390 --> 00:12:15,230
Whatever!
Let's eat 'em anyway!

185
00:12:15,520 --> 00:12:17,400
They're pretty uppity for
a bunch of hairballs!

186
00:12:17,480 --> 00:12:19,110
Don't call us hairballs!

187
00:12:19,280 --> 00:12:20,480
Everyone, to me!

188
00:12:21,070 --> 00:12:22,820
T-That's all, folks!

189
00:12:24,780 --> 00:12:25,780
They ran away!

190
00:12:25,870 --> 00:12:27,700
Hey! You don't suppose
those things were--

191
00:12:27,830 --> 00:12:28,990
I'm starving...

192
00:12:29,080 --> 00:12:31,540
You're right! They seemed
like Beastmen!

193
00:12:31,620 --> 00:12:35,040
I never let a single
Beastman escape!

194
00:12:41,300 --> 00:12:46,130
Any Beastmen hanging around here
must be with that 16-faced bastard!

195
00:12:46,390 --> 00:12:49,100
Those things are what
we've been hunting!

196
00:12:55,060 --> 00:12:56,190
The Black Siblings...

197
00:12:56,310 --> 00:12:57,020
...are on...

198
00:12:57,310 --> 00:12:58,650
...the job!

199
00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:06,450
Crap...

200
00:13:06,530 --> 00:13:09,950
Simon! Team Gurren
is going, too!

201
00:13:10,030 --> 00:13:11,030
Bro...

202
00:13:11,160 --> 00:13:12,450
What are you doing?

203
00:13:17,540 --> 00:13:19,130
- It's no use, they bounce right off.
- Bro!

204
00:13:21,050 --> 00:13:22,590
Almost there!

205
00:13:23,380 --> 00:13:24,420
Oh, crap!

206
00:13:27,970 --> 00:13:30,430
Let the pros handle this, amateur!

207
00:13:33,770 --> 00:13:37,060
Hurry up, Simon!
We'll take 'em down in Gurren Lagann!

208
00:13:45,610 --> 00:13:50,450
How can this be? How can
they operate Gunmen?!

209
00:13:50,830 --> 00:13:53,330
I won't stand for it!

210
00:13:53,540 --> 00:13:54,950
Come on, Simon!
Time to combine!

211
00:13:55,040 --> 00:13:56,330
Okay!

212
00:13:57,830 --> 00:13:58,870
Dumbass!

213
00:14:01,500 --> 00:14:02,960
What was that for, Bro?

214
00:14:03,050 --> 00:14:06,760
Quit your whining! Don't you
remember your training, Simon?

215
00:14:06,840 --> 00:14:09,880
We're gonna get killed if we don't do something!
Hurry, we have to combine!

216
00:14:09,970 --> 00:14:11,550
What the--?

217
00:14:12,510 --> 00:14:14,310
Combining with a measly
two units? Ha!

218
00:14:14,390 --> 00:14:18,430
I'll show you what combining
is all about!

219
00:14:18,770 --> 00:14:21,770
This is combining
using 16 faces!

220
00:14:26,740 --> 00:14:31,200
I'm surprised. I had no idea there
were other combining Gunmen.

221
00:14:31,910 --> 00:14:34,620
Isn't that how
all Gunmen work?

222
00:14:36,620 --> 00:14:38,410
- It combined?!
- Dumbass!

223
00:14:38,580 --> 00:14:42,880
That ain't combining!
Proper combining is all about--

224
00:14:44,670 --> 00:14:45,630
Bro!

225
00:14:48,670 --> 00:14:50,760
If we don't do something,
we're history!

226
00:14:58,810 --> 00:15:01,980
Damn it, Simon! Manly combining
is a thing of beauty,

227
00:15:02,060 --> 00:15:04,440
..an act of two souls that
are a blazing inferno!

228
00:15:04,980 --> 00:15:07,610
Would you just shut up
and combine already?

229
00:15:07,690 --> 00:15:11,400
He's right! Gurren Lagann's combining
is something else entirely!

230
00:15:15,240 --> 00:15:16,240
Boota?

231
00:15:19,710 --> 00:15:21,120
Thanks, Boota.

232
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:23,880
But why does Kamina
keep doing that?

233
00:15:29,880 --> 00:15:31,510
Jump!

234
00:15:32,680 --> 00:15:36,550
I get it!
Bro, I get it!

235
00:15:36,680 --> 00:15:38,310
Bro!

236
00:15:49,650 --> 00:15:50,610
Simon!

237
00:15:50,740 --> 00:15:52,110
Bro!

238
00:16:07,500 --> 00:16:08,460
Simon!

239
00:16:08,750 --> 00:16:09,500
Yoko!

240
00:16:15,640 --> 00:16:19,140
Stupid little kid...
Guess I'd better do something.

241
00:16:20,270 --> 00:16:20,850
What're you--

242
00:16:20,980 --> 00:16:22,140
We're going in.

243
00:16:25,520 --> 00:16:28,060
Sorry, Bro...
That's all I've got.

244
00:16:28,190 --> 00:16:30,270
Simon! Run!

245
00:16:30,650 --> 00:16:31,610
Yoko?

246
00:16:31,690 --> 00:16:33,950
Simon! Start running!

247
00:16:34,030 --> 00:16:35,320
Yoko!

248
00:16:35,490 --> 00:16:37,450
Look, the kid's running!

249
00:16:37,530 --> 00:16:38,450
Throw your bombs!

250
00:16:38,910 --> 00:16:39,780
Hurry!

251
00:16:43,660 --> 00:16:46,040
Oh, I get it!
We set up a smoke screen!

252
00:16:46,330 --> 00:16:48,330
- Good thinking!
- I have my moments.

253
00:16:49,040 --> 00:16:51,590
Those 16 bastards
are freaking out!

254
00:16:58,550 --> 00:16:59,640
Simon!

255
00:17:02,310 --> 00:17:05,520
I understand now! I get what you
were trying to teach me!

256
00:17:07,060 --> 00:17:10,360
Compared to those rocks you lobbed
at me, dodging these is easy!

257
00:17:10,480 --> 00:17:12,440
- You're missing the point.
- Look, Bro!

258
00:17:13,240 --> 00:17:14,360
Ow!

259
00:17:15,320 --> 00:17:16,570
That's it!

260
00:17:17,240 --> 00:17:22,040
Manly combining is about fighting spirit!
The beauty of soaring through the air!

261
00:17:54,610 --> 00:18:00,070
Brotherly Combining!
Gurren Lagann!

262
00:18:05,540 --> 00:18:07,160
Now THAT'S how it's done.

263
00:18:07,460 --> 00:18:08,920
Gurren Lagann?

264
00:18:09,120 --> 00:18:11,080
That was wicked cool!

265
00:18:12,920 --> 00:18:15,800
Sixteen-face combining!

266
00:18:15,880 --> 00:18:17,050
That thing is big, all right...

267
00:18:17,170 --> 00:18:19,970
So what? That just makes him
a big blockhead.

268
00:18:20,180 --> 00:18:21,970
What did you call me?!

269
00:18:26,180 --> 00:18:27,140
Kittan!

270
00:18:29,350 --> 00:18:32,900
Hey! Kiyoh!
Kinon! Kiyal!

271
00:18:33,820 --> 00:18:36,440
Damn it... Damn it...

272
00:18:42,280 --> 00:18:44,450
It's no use... I can't work up
the energy.

273
00:18:44,660 --> 00:18:47,750
We're screwed!
There no food anywhere!

274
00:18:54,800 --> 00:18:57,840
What, Boota? You want me
to eat your tail?

275
00:18:59,880 --> 00:19:00,880
Okay...

276
00:19:02,430 --> 00:19:03,640
Bro!

277
00:19:03,720 --> 00:19:05,350
What now, Simon?

278
00:19:06,600 --> 00:19:08,470
Even this drill is starting
to look tasty...

279
00:19:08,680 --> 00:19:11,310
Bro! Put this in your stomach!

280
00:19:12,810 --> 00:19:14,190
This is...

281
00:19:16,650 --> 00:19:18,730
...delicious!

282
00:19:27,450 --> 00:19:30,290
Having lots of faces
doesn't make you great.

283
00:19:30,370 --> 00:19:34,080
Manly combining isn't like
some tawdry love affair...

284
00:19:34,170 --> 00:19:37,500
...where you come and go
as you please!

285
00:19:39,970 --> 00:19:42,880
That isn't a true bond!

286
00:19:43,340 --> 00:19:45,680
That's just a sham, a pale imitation
of the real thing!

287
00:19:46,560 --> 00:19:48,680
What in the world is
he rambling on about?

288
00:19:48,770 --> 00:19:50,680
True bonds, huh?

289
00:19:50,730 --> 00:19:52,850
That's it!
That's what is different!

290
00:19:53,230 --> 00:19:57,020
Your combining doesn't have
any principles to stick to!

291
00:19:57,150 --> 00:19:59,860
Bro! Our arm! Drills are
coming out of our arm!

292
00:20:02,150 --> 00:20:04,450
So allow me
to stick it to YOU!

293
00:20:07,660 --> 00:20:08,740
Let's do it!

294
00:20:08,830 --> 00:20:10,370
- One!
- Two!

295
00:20:10,450 --> 00:20:11,830
- Three!
- Four!

296
00:20:12,580 --> 00:20:13,750
Five!

297
00:20:18,210 --> 00:20:19,800
Jamo!

298
00:20:19,880 --> 00:20:22,170
- Fifteen!
- Sixteen!

299
00:20:22,590 --> 00:20:25,010
See, we stuck you
with our own principles!

300
00:20:26,140 --> 00:20:27,800
Gurren Lagann
is fearsome, indeed...

301
00:20:44,240 --> 00:20:48,240
Let's get out of here!
Be careful on the streets at night!

302
00:20:48,410 --> 00:20:50,410
- They did it!
- I knew Kamina could do it!

303
00:20:50,540 --> 00:20:52,660
That Gunmen of theirs
is awesome!

304
00:20:52,790 --> 00:20:54,910
Oh, you girls are alive?

305
00:20:55,210 --> 00:20:56,670
That was a close call.

306
00:20:56,750 --> 00:20:59,630
We came this close
to being buried alive.

307
00:21:00,500 --> 00:21:02,420
What's the matter, big brother?

308
00:21:02,550 --> 00:21:05,680
I can't help it!
I thought you guys were...

309
00:21:05,800 --> 00:21:09,180
We're a lot tougher
than that. Right?

310
00:21:09,300 --> 00:21:11,600
C'mon, let's go see
Kamina and Simon!

311
00:21:12,020 --> 00:21:13,980
Hey! Come back here!

312
00:21:16,850 --> 00:21:19,650
Looks like I'll be up all night
making repairs again.

313
00:21:22,360 --> 00:21:24,530
Hey! Hairmateur!

314
00:21:24,610 --> 00:21:25,990
What the hell is that?

315
00:21:26,070 --> 00:21:28,820
It means someone who's a hair's width
better than a regular amateur.

316
00:21:28,910 --> 00:21:31,620
Hey! You still wanna start
something with me?

317
00:21:31,700 --> 00:21:34,790
If you ever want to join the
Black Siblings, come find us anytime.

318
00:21:36,250 --> 00:21:39,040
But you'll be the good-for-nothing
youngest of the family!

319
00:21:39,130 --> 00:21:42,460
And if YOU ever wanna join Team Gurren,
home of all things manly,

320
00:21:42,550 --> 00:21:44,550
...give me a shout whenever!

321
00:21:45,050 --> 00:21:46,170
See ya!

322
00:21:46,260 --> 00:21:47,970
Bye bye, darling!

323
00:21:48,800 --> 00:21:51,510
I proclaim my undying adoration
for you, Kamina!

324
00:21:52,010 --> 00:21:54,930
See ya, guys!
We'll meet again someday!

325
00:21:57,440 --> 00:22:00,060
Goodbye!

326
00:22:04,070 --> 00:22:05,400
Well, they're gone.

327
00:22:05,490 --> 00:22:07,030
Yeah...

328
00:22:07,240 --> 00:22:09,820
You know, that snack earlier
was really tasty.

329
00:22:10,660 --> 00:22:12,030
That's all you get!

330
00:22:14,450 --> 00:22:17,710
Simon, get back here!
Let me have some!

331
00:22:17,790 --> 00:22:18,870
Forget it!

332
00:22:18,960 --> 00:22:21,000
You want some, too,
don't you, Boota?

333
00:22:21,540 --> 00:22:22,540
Pretty please, Simon?

334
00:22:22,670 --> 00:22:24,840
No! Absolutely not!

335
00:22:25,550 --> 00:22:27,800
Hey, Simon!
Simon, c'mon!

336
00:22:27,880 --> 00:22:29,970
Forget it!

337
00:22:31,010 --> 00:22:34,930
To Be Continued...

338
00:22:42,250 --> 00:22:48,480
<font color=#FFFF00>Hikari wo motomete kage ha tawainai jooku wo shaberu
</font>'Cuz they seek light, the shadows chatter out grade-school jokes

339
00:22:48,480 --> 00:22:54,460
<font color=#FFFF00>Kikitai no ha sonna koto ja nai
</font>I don't want to listen to that crap

340
00:23:00,930 --> 00:23:06,990
<font color=#FFFF00>Taiyou motomete kage ha tamashii no nuketa koe kara
</font>'Cuz they seek the sun, the shadows suddenly change from

341
00:23:06,990 --> 00:23:12,870
<font color=#FFFF00>Kyuu ni surudoi kuchou ni kawaru
</font>The soul's missing voice to a sharp tone of voice

342
00:23:13,030 --> 00:23:19,580
<font color=#FFFF00>Sono oto ga machi no naka ni kodama-shite hibikinagara
</font>While that sound echoed and bounced in the middle of town,

343
00:23:19,580 --> 00:23:25,620
<font color=#FFFF00>Kemono no you na koe de sakebitsudzuketa
</font>I kept on screaming in a beastly voice

344
00:23:25,660 --> 00:23:28,890
<font color=#FFFF00>Kidou wo kaeta tsumori ha nai
</font>No way I'm going to change my course

345
00:23:28,890 --> 00:23:32,090
<font color=#FFFF00>Zankyou ha giratsuiteru ga
</font>The reverb's dazzling, but

346
00:23:32,090 --> 00:23:35,130
<font color=#FFFF00>Kussetsu-shite hanarete iku
</font>It refracts and comes apart

347
00:23:35,130 --> 00:23:39,260
<font color=#FFFF00>Koko no sekai ha itsumo kou da
</font>The world right here is always like this

348
00:23:46,180 --> 00:23:52,700
<font color=#FFFF00>Soto no sekai ni ha hikari ha aru no ka
</font>Is there light in the world outside?

00:24:05,440 --> 00:24:08,440
<b>Next Time</b>

350
00:24:06,610 --> 00:24:09,780
There are things you know in your head,
and things you know in your gut.

351
00:24:09,990 --> 00:24:12,990
Even if you react instinctively,
it's not the same as using your head.

352
00:24:13,360 --> 00:24:15,410
That's one thing I just don't get!

353
00:24:15,620 --> 00:24:20,450
<b>I Don't Get it, Not One Bit!</b>

354
00:24:15,620 --> 00:24:19,700
Next time on Gurren Lagann,
"I Don't Get it, Not One Bit!"
