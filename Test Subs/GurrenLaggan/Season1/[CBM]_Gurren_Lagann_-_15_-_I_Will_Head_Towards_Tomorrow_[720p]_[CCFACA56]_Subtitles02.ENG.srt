1
00:00:15,340 --> 00:00:17,470
Huge buildings are falling this way!

2
00:00:17,850 --> 00:00:21,430
What in the world is happening?!

3
00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:26,520
This is the tale of a man who continues
to fight against fate.

4
00:00:33,190 --> 00:00:34,650
Damn!
Gabal, fall back!

5
00:00:34,780 --> 00:00:36,110
Aye, aye!

6
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:52,500
What the hell is going on?

7
00:00:52,590 --> 00:00:54,170
What IS all this?!

8
00:00:54,340 --> 00:00:55,920
Brother!

9
00:00:56,050 --> 00:00:59,260
Quit your squealing, just run!

10
00:01:00,390 --> 00:01:03,970
Simon! We should evacuate
to a safe location, too!

11
00:01:04,060 --> 00:01:05,430
Y-Yeah.

12
00:01:33,380 --> 00:01:35,590
I don't believe it...
It can't be...

13
00:01:38,590 --> 00:01:43,930
At that very moment, fate took shape
and revealed itself to the man.

14
00:01:45,810 --> 00:01:47,980
A Gunmen?!

15
00:01:46,980 --> 00:01:52,940
<font color=#9A0E19>Gurren Lagann</font>

16
00:01:53,190 --> 00:01:58,950
<font color=#000000>Episode 15:
I Will Head Towards Tomorrow</font>

17
00:02:02,450 --> 00:02:04,790
Look at the size of that thing!

18
00:02:04,910 --> 00:02:07,120
This has to be against
some rule or other...

19
00:02:09,330 --> 00:02:12,790
I'm getting something from Teppelin's
old location! The pattern is...

20
00:02:13,960 --> 00:02:14,880
It can't be!

21
00:02:14,920 --> 00:02:15,710
What's wrong?

22
00:02:15,800 --> 00:02:18,840
This signature is...
It's Gurren Lagann!

23
00:02:19,130 --> 00:02:20,220
What?!

24
00:02:20,300 --> 00:02:23,390
I'm picking up another reading that's
completely identical to Gurren Lagann's!

25
00:02:37,070 --> 00:02:38,320
What's that?

26
00:02:40,660 --> 00:02:42,490
That's...

27
00:02:45,160 --> 00:02:46,370
Father!

28
00:02:48,790 --> 00:02:49,960
Nia?

29
00:02:50,830 --> 00:02:52,170
That means--

30
00:02:52,250 --> 00:02:55,170
That's the Spiral King, Lordgenome...

31
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,210
That's him!

32
00:02:58,050 --> 00:03:00,260
I just need to defeat him!

33
00:03:13,400 --> 00:03:15,190
That's the whole thing?

34
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:27,910
Is that all you have, human?

35
00:03:34,670 --> 00:03:36,000
Simon!

36
00:03:38,760 --> 00:03:39,960
Nice catch!

37
00:03:40,050 --> 00:03:41,380
Ow...

38
00:03:41,510 --> 00:03:43,510
- Simon, are you okay?
- Yeah, somehow...

39
00:03:43,640 --> 00:03:46,470
I can't believe that the drill tip
couldn't penetrate that.

40
00:03:47,510 --> 00:03:49,510
Simon, do this for me.

41
00:03:49,640 --> 00:03:52,640
Take me to my father!

42
00:03:53,020 --> 00:03:54,230
Nia?

43
00:03:54,350 --> 00:03:57,440
I want to speak to my father.

44
00:03:57,520 --> 00:04:02,490
That's crazy! Lordgenome isn't going
to let us get anywhere near him!

45
00:04:02,570 --> 00:04:05,160
We should focus on working out
a long-range attack plan,

46
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:07,660
...not getting close enough
to have a chat!

47
00:04:07,740 --> 00:04:09,870
Rossiu, have you forgotten?

48
00:04:09,950 --> 00:04:13,210
This girl has come all this way to give
her father a piece of her mind.

49
00:04:13,290 --> 00:04:13,960
But that's--

50
00:04:14,040 --> 00:04:18,710
When a girl sets her mind to something,
a good man is obliged to let her do it.

51
00:04:20,340 --> 00:04:21,920
Please, I beg you!

52
00:04:22,260 --> 00:04:23,920
Sure! Let's go, Nia!

53
00:04:24,010 --> 00:04:25,590
Are you serious, Simon?

54
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:27,010
You better believe it!

55
00:04:27,100 --> 00:04:28,760
I'm coming, too, Simon!

56
00:04:28,850 --> 00:04:32,520
If I don't give that guy a swift kick in the ass,
I won't be able to live with myself!

57
00:04:32,640 --> 00:04:35,020
- Yeah!
- What he said!

58
00:04:36,900 --> 00:04:39,480
I hate to break it to you,
but that doesn't seem likely.

59
00:04:39,570 --> 00:04:40,900
Say what?!

60
00:04:50,370 --> 00:04:54,450
Rossiu was right. They aren't going
to let us just walk up to him.

61
00:04:54,750 --> 00:04:56,460
How many of those damn things
are there?

62
00:04:56,750 --> 00:04:59,170
I like the looks of this, Kiyoh!

63
00:04:59,500 --> 00:05:02,670
Yeah. With this many enemies,
we can finally show the world...

64
00:05:02,760 --> 00:05:05,260
...what the Black Siblings
are capable of.

65
00:05:05,590 --> 00:05:06,760
You guys...

66
00:05:06,840 --> 00:05:08,470
Ain't that right, Brother?

67
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:12,260
Yeah, it sure is.
But she's wrong about one thing.

68
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:16,600
It ain't the power of the Black Siblings
that we're gonna show 'em.

69
00:05:16,980 --> 00:05:20,310
It's the power of Team Dai-Gurren!

70
00:05:20,570 --> 00:05:22,610
Yeah!

71
00:05:23,990 --> 00:05:28,240
Get going, Simon! We'll open up
a path for Dai-Gurren!

72
00:05:28,490 --> 00:05:29,200
Kittan...

73
00:05:29,450 --> 00:05:32,780
Give that guy
a few whacks for us, too!

74
00:05:37,370 --> 00:05:38,580
I will.

75
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:56,270
Thanks, Simon.

76
00:05:56,680 --> 00:05:58,390
- Here we go!
- Ready!

77
00:06:09,450 --> 00:06:11,070
Dai-Gurren, lift off!

78
00:06:11,160 --> 00:06:12,410
Lifting off!

79
00:06:21,750 --> 00:06:23,090
Here they come!

80
00:06:29,800 --> 00:06:31,930
Outta the way!

81
00:06:32,930 --> 00:06:35,060
You won't beat us!

82
00:06:52,200 --> 00:06:55,700
- There's a thin patch on the right!
- Good! Don't miss this chance!

83
00:07:00,210 --> 00:07:03,500
We can do it if Gurren Lagann
pools its strength with Dai-Gurren!

84
00:07:03,670 --> 00:07:07,460
Oh? The end result
will be the same.

85
00:07:12,390 --> 00:07:13,890
- Let's do it!
- Let's do it!

86
00:07:18,520 --> 00:07:20,430
- Open fire!
- Open fire!

87
00:07:30,820 --> 00:07:32,530
- Fire the Knife Anchor!
- Fire the Knife Anchor!

88
00:07:51,050 --> 00:07:52,170
We did it!

89
00:07:52,260 --> 00:07:53,970
We got you to where you
were going, Simon.

90
00:07:56,100 --> 00:07:57,220
Explosion in the engine room!

91
00:07:57,560 --> 00:08:00,970
Fires breaking out in main shaft
and generator room!

92
00:08:01,480 --> 00:08:04,690
Ron! That last burst
was all we had.

93
00:08:04,770 --> 00:08:06,900
It's okay,
that's all we needed.

94
00:08:07,110 --> 00:08:09,770
Let's put the old girl
to bed.

95
00:08:11,570 --> 00:08:13,820
What's wrong?
What was that explosion?

96
00:08:14,320 --> 00:08:18,490
Don't worry about us, Simon.
You go to Lordgenome.

97
00:08:18,620 --> 00:08:19,330
Yeah, but--

98
00:08:19,620 --> 00:08:21,330
Hurry up and get going!

99
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:23,250
Yoko...

100
00:08:23,330 --> 00:08:27,210
Go, Simon. That's what we've all
been working so hard for.

101
00:08:29,130 --> 00:08:30,630
I understand.

102
00:08:35,720 --> 00:08:39,890
Okay, Dai-Gurren.
Time for your last job.

103
00:08:40,720 --> 00:08:42,770
Set the timers on the explosives
in the powder magazine!

104
00:08:42,810 --> 00:08:43,930
Set!

105
00:08:44,020 --> 00:08:45,270
Detonate!

106
00:08:45,390 --> 00:08:47,900
Emergency ejection!

107
00:09:03,790 --> 00:09:06,620
It's all up to you now, Simon.

108
00:09:11,420 --> 00:09:16,680
Well, I see that you've somehow
managed to arrive, man of the Spiral.

109
00:09:17,130 --> 00:09:18,760
Lordgenome!

110
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:31,150
Nicely dodged!

111
00:09:31,940 --> 00:09:34,280
I expected nothing less, Simon!

112
00:09:34,690 --> 00:09:35,940
Viral!

113
00:09:37,490 --> 00:09:40,990
<font color=#FFC9B9>Gurren Lagann</font>

114
00:09:42,490 --> 00:09:46,000
<font color=#FFC9B9>Gurren Lagann</font>

115
00:09:50,460 --> 00:09:52,540
I'm a whole new man today.

116
00:09:52,840 --> 00:09:53,590
What?

117
00:09:53,670 --> 00:09:57,970
I have a new body that can go on fighting
indefinitely without needing sleep!

118
00:09:58,550 --> 00:10:00,430
I've overcome the limits
of the Beastmen!

119
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:03,430
This place will be
your grave, Simon!

120
00:10:05,180 --> 00:10:06,310
What?!

121
00:10:08,270 --> 00:10:10,020
T-This isn't possible!

122
00:10:11,020 --> 00:10:13,020
How can this be?!

123
00:10:15,690 --> 00:10:18,490
Why?! Why can't I beat him?!

124
00:10:18,780 --> 00:10:21,490
Viral, you poor creature.

125
00:10:21,660 --> 00:10:22,570
Majesty?

126
00:10:22,700 --> 00:10:26,910
The power I gave you isn't meant
to overcome humans.

127
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:37,300
M-Majesty...

128
00:10:37,380 --> 00:10:40,800
To begin with, no Beastman
will ever be a match against...

129
00:10:41,090 --> 00:10:44,550
...a human who has acquired
the power of the Spiral.

130
00:10:45,140 --> 00:10:51,020
Viral, it's true that I gave you
a body that cannot die.

131
00:10:51,270 --> 00:10:53,860
But it was not so that
you could fight.

132
00:10:54,650 --> 00:10:58,820
It is so you could be a storyteller
who will recount for all time...

133
00:10:58,940 --> 00:11:01,820
...the victory of the
Spiral King.

134
00:11:02,570 --> 00:11:03,780
Your storyteller?

135
00:11:04,030 --> 00:11:06,740
Stay where you are
and observe.

136
00:11:06,830 --> 00:11:09,200
Observe the fate of
a foolish human.

137
00:11:09,500 --> 00:11:12,670
And until the end of time,
tell your listeners...

138
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:18,130
...of the futility of raising the flag
of rebellion against the Spiral King.

139
00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:23,970
Ah, Nia.

140
00:11:24,050 --> 00:11:26,470
It has been a long time, Father.

141
00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:31,310
You're looking well. I didn't
expect to see your face again.

142
00:11:31,390 --> 00:11:33,600
Why are you doing this, Father?

143
00:11:33,770 --> 00:11:37,650
You drive humans underground, and kill
them if they come to the surface.

144
00:11:37,730 --> 00:11:39,280
It is horrible!

145
00:11:39,570 --> 00:11:43,280
Why would you do such
a cruel thing?

146
00:11:50,250 --> 00:11:52,580
Oh, ignorance is
a frightening thing.

147
00:11:52,750 --> 00:11:56,840
You might believe yourselves to be fighting
on the side of righteousness,

148
00:11:56,920 --> 00:11:59,670
...but I am the one who is
protecting this world.

149
00:11:59,840 --> 00:12:05,140
It is I, Lordgenome,
who is the guardian of humanity.

150
00:12:05,720 --> 00:12:07,100
What are you saying?

151
00:12:07,180 --> 00:12:10,560
There can be no such thing as
a guardian who kills his charges.

152
00:12:11,180 --> 00:12:14,520
Don't you see that there is something
wrong with this world?

153
00:12:14,900 --> 00:12:20,530
Nia, this world that I have created is the
only path to ensure humanity's survival.

154
00:12:20,860 --> 00:12:26,530
You and your friends have strayed from
that path, and I cannot allow that to continue.

155
00:12:26,700 --> 00:12:29,910
For the sake of humanity, you must die.

156
00:12:36,250 --> 00:12:39,500
The Spiral Power is strong within you.

157
00:12:40,050 --> 00:12:43,470
Yet you are unaware that such power
leads only to destruction.

158
00:12:44,430 --> 00:12:46,430
Allow me to teach you.

159
00:12:49,430 --> 00:12:52,100
Teach you how foolish that is.

160
00:12:56,100 --> 00:12:59,560
You are not the only one who
possesses the power of the Spiral.

161
00:13:00,360 --> 00:13:05,280
I will show you
what true Spiral Power is.

162
00:13:08,700 --> 00:13:11,160
Using my Lazengann.

163
00:13:16,830 --> 00:13:18,170
Father?

164
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:19,960
That's...

165
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,710
<b>Spiral King's Personal Gunmen:
Lazengann</b>

166
00:13:20,460 --> 00:13:22,710
That's a Gurren Lagann-type!

167
00:13:22,960 --> 00:13:26,170
This is the source of the identical
Gurren Lagann reading?

168
00:13:31,560 --> 00:13:34,390
Nia, I have no choice
but to fight him.

169
00:13:35,270 --> 00:13:36,350
Right.

170
00:13:55,910 --> 00:13:58,670
There was once a man
who fought as you do.

171
00:13:58,920 --> 00:14:02,840
He also was unaware that his actions
would doom humanity to extinction.

172
00:14:03,130 --> 00:14:04,250
What do you mean?

173
00:14:04,380 --> 00:14:07,800
You don't need to know.
After all, you will be dead soon.

174
00:14:22,940 --> 00:14:31,910
GIGA DRILL BREAK!

175
00:14:37,660 --> 00:14:39,080
Impossible!

176
00:15:00,690 --> 00:15:03,480
It's hopeless...
We can't possibly beat him...

177
00:15:03,610 --> 00:15:04,810
Don't give up!

178
00:15:05,230 --> 00:15:09,070
Rejecting common sense to make the
impossible possible is the Team Gurren way.

179
00:15:09,490 --> 00:15:11,610
Rossiu, have faith in me.

180
00:15:11,820 --> 00:15:14,120
Believe in the Simon
who believes in you.

181
00:15:14,870 --> 00:15:16,910
We still have some
fight left in us!

182
00:15:19,580 --> 00:15:22,460
You have strength enough
to get back to your feet, I see.

183
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:25,590
Even so,
it's a wasted effort.

184
00:15:26,090 --> 00:15:27,250
We'll see about that!

185
00:15:34,680 --> 00:15:36,600
- Rossiu!
- I'm all right!

186
00:15:36,970 --> 00:15:38,430
I'm not helpless...

187
00:15:38,970 --> 00:15:41,270
Now's your chance, Simon!
Use Lagann!

188
00:15:41,890 --> 00:15:43,270
Got it.

189
00:15:44,860 --> 00:15:46,900
You're in my way.

190
00:15:51,280 --> 00:15:53,530
LAGANN IMPACT!

191
00:15:57,620 --> 00:16:00,200
You hope to incorporate
my Lazengann, too, do you?

192
00:16:01,960 --> 00:16:03,250
He self-destructed?

193
00:16:03,460 --> 00:16:08,210
Well, well. I see that it was not a fluke
that you made it this far.

194
00:16:08,300 --> 00:16:11,090
However, your mischief ends here.

195
00:16:11,510 --> 00:16:15,800
Now that you have lost your body,
you don't have the slightest hope of winning.

196
00:16:16,430 --> 00:16:19,640
Quit your yammering!
I'm not gonna lose.

197
00:16:19,930 --> 00:16:22,270
Nia. Yoko.
Rossiu.

198
00:16:22,770 --> 00:16:24,520
Ron. Kittan.
Dayakka.

199
00:16:24,940 --> 00:16:27,480
Every member of Team Dai-Gurren
believes in me.

200
00:16:27,940 --> 00:16:31,440
The me that my Bro believed in,
the me that I believe in...

201
00:16:31,990 --> 00:16:35,150
...isn't possibly gonna lose
to the likes of you!

202
00:16:38,830 --> 00:16:43,710
You don't say. In that case,
I will pull out all the stops to crush you!

203
00:17:13,030 --> 00:17:16,700
I should have known I couldn't
trust a Gunmen to do the job!

204
00:17:44,810 --> 00:17:46,270
Simon!

205
00:18:00,280 --> 00:18:02,240
I can't produce
any more drills...!

206
00:18:02,410 --> 00:18:06,200
What's the matter?
Has your Spiral run dry?

207
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:07,960
Simon!

208
00:18:08,040 --> 00:18:11,630
Simon, if our faith in you is
what gives you your strength,

209
00:18:12,250 --> 00:18:14,750
...then I'll believe in you
with all my heart!

210
00:18:15,130 --> 00:18:17,050
So, please! Win!

211
00:18:24,600 --> 00:18:27,600
I haven't had this much fun
in a long time, boy.

212
00:18:29,350 --> 00:18:31,520
Now, back into the dirt
with you!

213
00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:37,690
A Core Drill?!

214
00:18:38,610 --> 00:18:40,400
My name is Simon.

215
00:18:40,490 --> 00:18:43,530
Simon the Digger,
leader of Team Dai-Gurren.

216
00:18:44,490 --> 00:18:47,950
If you decide to be a wall
that's standing in my way,

217
00:18:48,250 --> 00:18:51,370
...there's something that will
open a hole in you every time!

218
00:18:51,790 --> 00:18:54,840
And that something
is my drill!

219
00:19:10,600 --> 00:19:16,520
I see... Your Spiral Power
outstripped my own.

220
00:19:20,490 --> 00:19:25,240
You will come to regret it
once you learn its importance.

221
00:19:26,080 --> 00:19:27,200
Lordgenome...

222
00:19:27,660 --> 00:19:29,910
I will leave you with
this warning.

223
00:19:30,040 --> 00:19:33,370
When the land comes to overflow
with a million apes,

224
00:19:33,460 --> 00:19:38,670
...the moon shall become Hell's messenger
and destroy the world of the Spiral.

225
00:19:41,630 --> 00:19:43,130
What do you mean?!

226
00:19:46,350 --> 00:19:47,720
Father!

227
00:20:06,160 --> 00:20:08,370
Farewell, Father.

228
00:20:09,620 --> 00:20:12,370
I will head towards tomorrow.

229
00:20:23,130 --> 00:20:24,470
Simon!

230
00:20:28,220 --> 00:20:29,390
What happened?

231
00:20:29,850 --> 00:20:32,310
All enemy Gunmen have
stopped moving!

232
00:20:32,810 --> 00:20:35,140
You mean it's over?

233
00:20:41,940 --> 00:20:44,240
Wow! You did it, Simon!

234
00:21:04,420 --> 00:21:05,680
Simon...

235
00:21:05,760 --> 00:21:07,090
It's Gurren Lagann!

236
00:21:07,430 --> 00:21:10,100
They're all right!
They're coming home!
