00:00:10,670 --> 00:00:15,470
Gurren Lagann

2
00:00:15,470 --> 00:00:20,780
<font color=#FFFF00>Sugita kisetsu wo nageku hima ha nai
</font>I don't have the time to lament the seasons that have passed

3
00:00:20,780 --> 00:00:26,350
<font color=#FFFF00>Nido to mayotte shimawanu you ni
</font>So that I won't ever waver again

4
00:00:26,350 --> 00:00:31,660
<font color=#FFFF00>Kazoekirenai hon no sasayaka na
</font>With countless, tiny little

5
00:00:31,660 --> 00:00:36,560
<font color=#FFFF00>Sonna koukai kakaeta mama
</font>Regrets carried in my arms

6
00:00:36,660 --> 00:00:42,640
<font color=#FFFF00>Sono senaka dake oikakete koko made kitanda
</font>I've come this far, having chased only after your back

7
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:48,040
<font color=#FFFF00>Sagashite ita boku dake ni dekiru koto
</font>It's something only I, who sought you, can do

8
00:00:48,100 --> 00:00:53,110
<font color=#FFFF00>Ano hi kureta kotoba ga ima demo
</font>Those words you gave me that day, even now,

9
00:00:53,200 --> 00:00:58,940
<font color=#FFFF00>Kono mune ni tashika ni todoite iru kara
</font>Definitely reach my heart

10
00:00:59,050 --> 00:01:04,210
<font color=#FFFF00>Kinou yori mo kyou ha bu ha boku no
</font>I've realized my reason for having been born

11
00:01:04,250 --> 00:01:09,960
<font color=#FFFF00>Umarete kita wake ni kidzuite yuku
</font>Today more than I did yesterday

12
00:01:10,100 --> 00:01:18,830
<font color=#FFFF00>Kotae ha sou itsumo koko ni aru
</font>The answer, yes, is always right here

13
00:01:35,010 --> 00:01:37,880
This is the tale of a man who continues
to look for his own path,

14
00:01:38,180 --> 00:01:41,890
...even while he is being
betrayed by fate.

15
00:01:42,430 --> 00:01:46,890
The war between the Spiral races
and the Anti-Spiral.

16
00:01:46,980 --> 00:01:49,440
This was the root cause
of everything.

17
00:01:50,060 --> 00:01:53,070
In order to exterminate humanity,
in which Spiral Power lies dormant,

18
00:01:53,150 --> 00:01:55,280
...they send the moon plummeting
towards the Earth.

19
00:01:55,360 --> 00:01:58,950
It was Simon and his fellow Team Gurren
members who triggered this calamity.

20
00:01:59,780 --> 00:02:03,030
Will their struggle for freedom
lead to mankind's downfall?

21
00:02:03,120 --> 00:02:06,910
Having lost Nia, Simon is shackled
by the handcuffs of despair.

22
00:02:10,330 --> 00:02:16,090
<b>Episode 19:
We Will Survive, By Any Means Necessary</b>

23
00:02:19,630 --> 00:02:22,550
- Give us Simon!
- Make him pay for what he did!

24
00:02:24,350 --> 00:02:26,220
He was never a hero!

25
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:29,140
Simon is the cause of all this!

26
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:32,860
It's his fault that
the moon is falling!

27
00:02:43,870 --> 00:02:46,290
Rossiu.
Tell me why.

28
00:02:47,500 --> 00:02:51,960
The citizens who were evacuated to the
Parliament Tower have begun to riot.

29
00:02:52,630 --> 00:02:56,340
Our defeat of Lordgenome is what
set this catastrophe in motion.

30
00:02:56,460 --> 00:02:59,340
Team Dai-Gurren is to blame
for the moon falling from the sky.

31
00:02:59,630 --> 00:03:02,430
That anger is being directed
at the New Government.

32
00:03:03,510 --> 00:03:07,310
Your conversation with Nia was
broadcast live across the world.

33
00:03:07,390 --> 00:03:12,270
Every citizen now knows that the moon will
slam into the Earth in three weeks' time.

34
00:03:12,600 --> 00:03:16,980
Your reckless fight earlier was
also seen by the entire city.

35
00:03:17,320 --> 00:03:18,900
I can no longer protect you.

36
00:03:18,990 --> 00:03:20,110
Protect me?

37
00:03:22,990 --> 00:03:24,990
This is the guy!
It's all his fault!

38
00:03:25,070 --> 00:03:26,780
Tear it down!

39
00:03:35,670 --> 00:03:40,340
In their eyes, you are now
no different from Lordgenome.

40
00:03:40,470 --> 00:03:43,220
In which case, we must punish
you in the same manner.

41
00:03:43,300 --> 00:03:47,350
Exactly as we could not restrain
ourselves from doing back then.

42
00:03:53,390 --> 00:03:55,850
Please wait here until
it is time for your trial.

43
00:03:55,940 --> 00:03:57,060
Trial?

44
00:03:57,150 --> 00:03:59,440
We are now a nation
of laws.

45
00:03:59,570 --> 00:04:02,150
Questions of war responsibility
are also settled in a trial.

46
00:04:02,570 --> 00:04:05,030
First it was God's rules,
and now it's the law.

47
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:07,910
You're a man who loves to
be tied down, aren't you?

48
00:04:08,580 --> 00:04:12,500
We have always made progress
on the backs of the dead.

49
00:04:12,620 --> 00:04:15,250
Such as my mother.
And Kamina.

50
00:04:15,710 --> 00:04:17,000
What?

51
00:04:17,420 --> 00:04:20,380
When Kamina died,
it made us stronger.

52
00:04:20,460 --> 00:04:23,970
It was thanks to Kamina's death
that we were able to win that battle.

53
00:04:24,050 --> 00:04:25,430
Hold it right there, Rossiu!

54
00:04:25,510 --> 00:04:28,510
Are you trying to tell me that
my Bro's dying was a good thing?

55
00:04:30,770 --> 00:04:33,430
Judging it from the outcome
it produced, then yes, I am.

56
00:04:34,230 --> 00:04:37,980
Don't joke about that! There are
some things you can't say!

57
00:04:38,190 --> 00:04:42,190
Hey! You bastard!
Do you really think that?!

58
00:04:44,740 --> 00:04:47,110
You are exactly like Kamina
was in the old days.

59
00:04:47,200 --> 00:04:51,580
Have you learned nothing from his death?
You haven't grown at all!

60
00:04:54,540 --> 00:04:56,160
I will keep your Core Drill.

61
00:04:56,290 --> 00:05:02,090
It's ironic. The source of your power
was the seed of mankind's destruction.

62
00:05:02,840 --> 00:05:06,380
Rossiu, you'll never understand
what he was feeling.

63
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:10,220
Or what his death
gave to us.

64
00:05:12,810 --> 00:05:18,190
That look in your eyes... It's exactly the
same as the priest back in Adai Village.

65
00:05:20,820 --> 00:05:23,860
No, it is you who
understands nothing.

66
00:05:23,990 --> 00:05:27,280
You haven't so much as tried to
change in the past seven years.

67
00:05:27,820 --> 00:05:29,950
It is you.

68
00:05:33,330 --> 00:05:36,540
So it's true what they say?
Simon's been arrested?

69
00:05:36,830 --> 00:05:37,460
Yeah.

70
00:05:37,540 --> 00:05:40,460
Why would they do that?!
That's so messed up!

71
00:05:40,540 --> 00:05:42,880
That jerk Rossiu's
gone crazy!

72
00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:45,510
- Kiyal, don't shout in the hospital.
- Oops!

73
00:05:45,920 --> 00:05:47,970
What Rossiu says makes a
certain amount of sense.

74
00:05:48,050 --> 00:05:51,260
What he did to Simon might only
be a temporary solution.

75
00:05:52,220 --> 00:05:56,730
Rossiu might have common sense, but
he's so coldhearted that I can't stand him.

76
00:05:57,020 --> 00:05:59,230
What the heck does Kinon
see in that guy?

77
00:05:59,350 --> 00:06:00,270
Kiyal.

78
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:05,480
I don't care HOW busy she is, how can
she not even stop by to see Anne?

79
00:06:05,690 --> 00:06:07,690
Kinon's totally changed, too.

80
00:06:07,780 --> 00:06:08,990
Kiyal!

81
00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:13,450
Now, now. It's one thing to talk like that
in here, but don't say that outside.

82
00:06:13,910 --> 00:06:17,410
These days, there's no telling
what might happen.

83
00:06:21,080 --> 00:06:24,170
Send out Simon! The guy who's
responsible has to pay!

84
00:06:24,340 --> 00:06:26,590
Do you have a plan to deal
with the moon falling?!

85
00:06:26,710 --> 00:06:28,340
What's the government doing?!

86
00:06:28,590 --> 00:06:30,840
Give me back my house!
Reimburse me!

87
00:06:30,930 --> 00:06:33,300
I want my peaceful
life back!

88
00:06:34,310 --> 00:06:36,220
The Mugann's energy barrier
can be breached...

89
00:06:36,350 --> 00:06:39,350
...by using the Giga Drill to reflect
its beam back at it.

90
00:06:39,890 --> 00:06:43,230
The problem is, how do we stop
the body itself from exploding?

91
00:06:44,190 --> 00:06:45,730
This enemy
is pretty tricky...

92
00:06:45,820 --> 00:06:49,690
What I don't get is, aren't the Grapearls
superior to Gurren Lagann?

93
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:53,160
It isn't right for the prototype
to be more powerful.

94
00:06:53,240 --> 00:06:55,280
Goodness, what a cheeky
thing to say.

95
00:06:55,370 --> 00:06:59,000
Whatever shall I do to close
that mouth of yours?

96
00:07:00,500 --> 00:07:03,500
Ever since I was a kid, he's been
the one guy I can't deal with...

97
00:07:03,790 --> 00:07:06,170
What do you think is gonna
happen with Simon?

98
00:07:06,420 --> 00:07:07,460
You mean his arrest?

99
00:07:07,550 --> 00:07:09,550
Arrest?! Is he gonna
be executed?!

100
00:07:09,670 --> 00:07:11,840
Don't get ahead of yourself,
Aretenborough.

101
00:07:11,970 --> 00:07:15,100
I think that Rossiu has
something up his sleeve.

102
00:07:15,390 --> 00:07:21,060
Anyway, our task at hand is developing
weapons against our new enemies.

103
00:07:21,190 --> 00:07:23,900
I guess it's no sleep for us
until we come up with something...

104
00:07:24,440 --> 00:07:27,440
Aretenborough, turn this
report in to Rossiu.

105
00:07:27,530 --> 00:07:28,820
You got it!

106
00:07:30,110 --> 00:07:33,410
What...are...you...doing?!

107
00:07:34,280 --> 00:07:38,030
I said to turn in the report,
not to turn me! Honestly!

108
00:07:38,910 --> 00:07:41,370
Spinning?
Could it be...?

109
00:07:41,500 --> 00:07:43,620
Show us that again!

110
00:07:43,710 --> 00:07:44,830
You got it!

111
00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:49,710
Didn't you hear me?!
I said, NOT me!

112
00:07:53,220 --> 00:07:55,930
We have completed our survey
of surviving underground cities.

113
00:07:59,060 --> 00:08:02,560
Scattered around the world, there are
36 cities over 1000 meters underground...

114
00:08:02,640 --> 00:08:07,150
...whose construction is estimated to be
capable of withstanding the lunar impact.

115
00:08:07,570 --> 00:08:10,820
They are capable of holding
640,000 people.

116
00:08:11,240 --> 00:08:14,150
That's wonderful news.
That's more than we expected.

117
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:17,320
I suppose we owe a debt of gratitude
to the humans of the past...

118
00:08:17,620 --> 00:08:19,280
...whose civilization
reached such heights.

119
00:08:19,370 --> 00:08:24,250
Even so, those humans were
no match for the Anti-Spiral.

120
00:08:25,500 --> 00:08:29,790
Nevertheless, we will survive.
By any means necessary.

121
00:08:30,840 --> 00:08:33,130
That leaves 360,000.

122
00:08:33,380 --> 00:08:37,140
The citizens here in Kamina City
will be especially difficult.

123
00:08:37,220 --> 00:08:41,770
Advisor Rossiu! I found this file in the
biocomputer's deep-level database.

124
00:08:41,850 --> 00:08:44,480
What in the world...?
Where is it?!

125
00:08:44,690 --> 00:08:47,150
Right underneath Kamina City's
Parliament Tower.

126
00:08:56,820 --> 00:08:57,820
Amazing!

127
00:08:58,320 --> 00:09:02,910
That's the Spiral King for you... He had
this card up his sleeve the whole time.

128
00:09:06,500 --> 00:09:10,000
<font color=#FFC9B9>Gurren Lagann</font>

129
00:09:11,500 --> 00:09:15,010
<font color=#FFC9B9>Gurren Lagann</font>

130
00:09:20,350 --> 00:09:22,010
I will now hand down
the sentence.

131
00:09:22,100 --> 00:09:25,350
The defendant is hereby
sentenced to death.

132
00:09:26,440 --> 00:09:28,270
Hey, hold on a second!

133
00:09:28,350 --> 00:09:29,400
Get real!

134
00:09:29,480 --> 00:09:30,730
What the hell?!

135
00:09:30,860 --> 00:09:32,320
This don't make no sense!

136
00:09:34,400 --> 00:09:38,780
First of all, it was crazy to make
Balinbow his defense attorney!

137
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:42,660
And Guinble was the prosecutor,
and you were the judge!

138
00:09:42,830 --> 00:09:46,120
You never had any intention
of giving him a fair trial!

139
00:09:47,750 --> 00:09:50,830
I will have quiet in my courtroom,
Legal Affairs Chief Kittan.

140
00:09:50,920 --> 00:09:54,840
If no one is held responsible,
the populace will never be satisfied.

141
00:09:55,340 --> 00:09:59,300
Who do you suggest we hold responsible,
if not Supreme Commander Simon?

142
00:09:59,680 --> 00:10:02,430
But that don't mean you have
to have him put to death!

143
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:06,470
This may quiet down the unrest for now,
but what about afterwards?

144
00:10:06,770 --> 00:10:09,060
What do you plan to do
about the falling moon?

145
00:10:09,150 --> 00:10:11,940
An evacuation plan for that
very purpose is already underway.

146
00:10:12,400 --> 00:10:16,360
To ensure humanity's survival, we must
quell this foolish disturbance at once,

147
00:10:16,440 --> 00:10:19,450
...and then take calm,
swift action.

148
00:10:19,860 --> 00:10:21,570
Yes, with
Chief Advisor Rossiu,

149
00:10:22,280 --> 00:10:24,870
...no, with New Supreme Commander
Rossiu at its heart.

150
00:10:26,790 --> 00:10:30,920
New Supreme Commander...?
Is this some kind of coup, Rossiu?!

151
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:32,750
This is nothing of the sort.

152
00:10:32,840 --> 00:10:37,420
According to the law, the instant Simon
was found guilty, I succeeded him.

153
00:10:38,260 --> 00:10:42,840
Bro... If you were in my shoes
right now, what would you do?

154
00:10:46,850 --> 00:10:48,220
Nia?!

155
00:10:51,810 --> 00:10:53,190
Hey, it's Nia!

156
00:10:53,310 --> 00:10:54,520
Are you serious?!

157
00:10:54,610 --> 00:10:56,270
Where'd she come from?

158
00:10:57,570 --> 00:11:01,860
What the Anti-Spiral want
is absolute despair.

159
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:04,410
There is no hope of survival
for Spiral life.

160
00:11:04,700 --> 00:11:06,410
What are you saying, Nia?

161
00:11:06,490 --> 00:11:10,620
What do you mean, absolute despair?
Why are you doing this?!

162
00:11:14,090 --> 00:11:17,500
For the next two weeks,
meet your end...

163
00:11:17,800 --> 00:11:21,010
...in suffering as you clutch
desperately to life.

164
00:11:24,550 --> 00:11:26,760
Nia! Don't go!

165
00:11:31,480 --> 00:11:33,190
Cybela!
What's happened?

166
00:11:33,560 --> 00:11:36,520
I'm detecting a Mugann above
planned shelter area Littner.

167
00:11:36,650 --> 00:11:38,650
It's a good deal larger than
what we've seen before.

168
00:11:51,790 --> 00:11:56,580
T-This is Littner Sector! A huge clump
of Mugann is heading this way!

169
00:12:00,170 --> 00:12:01,590
We're under attack!

170
00:12:02,680 --> 00:12:05,680
They're pulling out all the stops!
The shelter can't take much of this!

171
00:12:06,640 --> 00:12:09,810
Request immediate assistance!
Help us! Please, help us!

172
00:12:11,520 --> 00:12:15,770
The Mugann have apparently begun
moving towards Kamina city.

173
00:12:18,230 --> 00:12:19,690
Littner...

174
00:12:21,110 --> 00:12:23,950
What's happened to Littner?

175
00:12:25,570 --> 00:12:27,620
Back to the Operations Room!

176
00:12:27,990 --> 00:12:29,620
Rossiu, wait!

177
00:12:31,040 --> 00:12:34,290
Let me... Let me pilot
Gurren Lagann.

178
00:12:34,670 --> 00:12:36,080
What did you say?

179
00:12:36,170 --> 00:12:40,000
Gurren Lagann is our only means
of fighting against them.

180
00:12:40,380 --> 00:12:43,420
Trying to redeem yourself
through an act of heroism, eh?

181
00:12:43,550 --> 00:12:46,630
That has nothing to do with it!
I just want to protect the city!

182
00:12:46,760 --> 00:12:48,550
Nevertheless, you are
a condemned man.

183
00:12:48,640 --> 00:12:52,220
Am I supposed to entrust a prisoner with
Gurren Lagann when he might escape in it?

184
00:12:53,270 --> 00:12:54,680
Rossiu, you son
of a bitch!

185
00:12:54,810 --> 00:12:59,860
Then wire me with a bomb or something!
If I run, all you have to do is detonate it!

186
00:13:11,950 --> 00:13:13,080
Guinble.

187
00:13:13,290 --> 00:13:14,250
Sir.

188
00:13:14,330 --> 00:13:17,040
Disengage the lock on the
Core Drill storeroom.

189
00:13:17,460 --> 00:13:20,960
And don't forget to wire Gurren
with explosives. Have it done at once!

190
00:13:24,630 --> 00:13:26,720
Gurren Lagann, heading out!

191
00:13:26,930 --> 00:13:29,430
Roger that.
I'm standing by and ready to go.

192
00:13:29,510 --> 00:13:32,350
Kinon? What are you
doing aboard Gurren?

193
00:13:32,390 --> 00:13:35,680
I've wired the detonator switch
to my belt.

194
00:13:35,810 --> 00:13:36,560
What?!

195
00:13:36,640 --> 00:13:42,110
Simon, if you try anything funny,
anything at all, I'll hit the switch.

196
00:13:42,190 --> 00:13:44,280
This is crazy!
What do you think you're doing?!

197
00:13:45,030 --> 00:13:47,150
Why does Kinon have
to come with me?!

198
00:13:47,240 --> 00:13:50,740
With her aboard, you have no choice
but to return to base intact.

199
00:13:50,870 --> 00:13:55,830
If it were just you, I expect you would
try to go out in a blaze of heroic glory.

200
00:13:56,250 --> 00:13:59,290
That doesn't mean you need
to risk Kinon's life like this!

201
00:13:59,420 --> 00:14:01,170
I volunteered to do this.

202
00:14:01,250 --> 00:14:02,290
Kinon?!

203
00:14:02,590 --> 00:14:06,130
It's all right. If we make it back in
one piece, there won't be any trouble.

204
00:14:07,090 --> 00:14:10,180
Come home safe and sound so I can
be put to death properly, huh?

205
00:14:11,350 --> 00:14:13,890
- Let's go!
- R-Right!

206
00:14:18,980 --> 00:14:22,150
Commander Rossiu, we are
ready for your broadcast.

207
00:14:25,650 --> 00:14:28,440
Hey, ain't that
Gurren Lagann up there?

208
00:14:28,530 --> 00:14:32,070
But Simon was arrested, wasn't he?
What's going on?

209
00:14:34,290 --> 00:14:36,540
Stand by for an urgent message
from the government.

210
00:14:36,660 --> 00:14:39,710
I repeat, stand by for an urgent message
from the government.

211
00:14:40,170 --> 00:14:41,420
My fellow citizens.

212
00:14:41,500 --> 00:14:45,250
The surface will be severely damaged by
an attack involving dropping the moon,

213
00:14:45,550 --> 00:14:48,300
...carried out by unknown enemies
calling themselves the Anti-Spiral.

214
00:14:48,670 --> 00:14:53,850
In response, the New Government pressed
charges against Former Commander Simon.

215
00:14:53,930 --> 00:14:57,180
As a result of his trial today,
he was sentenced to death.

216
00:14:58,140 --> 00:14:59,350
There it is!

217
00:15:01,230 --> 00:15:03,860
I can't let that thing get
anywhere near Kamina City!

218
00:15:06,230 --> 00:15:09,280
Whatever it takes,
I'll stop it here!

219
00:15:09,780 --> 00:15:13,410
I have dispatched Former Commander
Simon in Gurren Lagann...

220
00:15:13,910 --> 00:15:17,620
...to intercept the Mugann that have
appeared outside Kamina City,

221
00:15:18,200 --> 00:15:20,750
...but he is completely under
the New Government's control.

222
00:15:20,870 --> 00:15:24,920
We are able to blow it up if he exhibits
any suspicious behavior whatsoever.

223
00:15:25,340 --> 00:15:27,380
Son of a...
Rossiu, you bastard!

224
00:15:27,840 --> 00:15:29,920
To protect its citizens from
the impending lunar impact,

225
00:15:30,010 --> 00:15:32,880
...the government will carry out
a large-scale evacuation plan.

226
00:15:33,300 --> 00:15:37,640
Citizens will be evacuated to 36 giant
underground shelters around the world.

227
00:15:37,770 --> 00:15:40,520
Residents in the Kamina city area,
which has no shelter,

228
00:15:40,600 --> 00:15:45,860
...will temporarily leave the stratosphere
in the Superdreadnought Space Dai-Gun.

229
00:15:46,070 --> 00:15:49,650
And this is that Space Dai-gun!
The Arc-Gurren!

230
00:15:59,450 --> 00:16:02,750
Have faith in the New Government!
We will not be defeated by the Anti-Spiral!

231
00:16:02,830 --> 00:16:05,460
We shall survive, no matter what!

232
00:16:08,550 --> 00:16:10,000
Rossiu!

233
00:16:10,170 --> 00:16:11,760
Rossiu!

234
00:16:12,170 --> 00:16:13,760
Rossiu!

235
00:16:13,970 --> 00:16:15,840
This will keep us alive!

236
00:16:15,930 --> 00:16:17,720
Rossiu!

237
00:16:27,020 --> 00:16:30,570
Simon! The Mugann have turned
around and are heading this way!

238
00:16:31,570 --> 00:16:34,700
That's what I want. Now, let's draw
them away from Kamina City!

239
00:16:37,160 --> 00:16:40,160
These guys are slow.
We'll go slow enough for them to keep up.

240
00:16:40,330 --> 00:16:41,370
Right!

241
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:43,250
The beams have stopped...

242
00:16:50,500 --> 00:16:52,590
Now they're just showing off...

243
00:17:00,760 --> 00:17:04,230
This is bad... They've got us heading
towards Kamina City again!

244
00:17:04,350 --> 00:17:08,060
Simon! That big Mugann has stayed
at a distance this whole time!

245
00:17:08,360 --> 00:17:10,480
It's possible that it's
their control tower!

246
00:17:10,820 --> 00:17:13,190
I follow you...
Let's put that to the test!

247
00:17:33,420 --> 00:17:34,460
You're mine!

248
00:17:37,760 --> 00:17:40,260
- Nia!
- Goodbye, Simon.

249
00:17:46,940 --> 00:17:48,230
We're surrounded!

250
00:17:49,270 --> 00:17:52,690
If this many fire at us at once, one Giga Drill
will never be able to deflect them all!

251
00:17:52,940 --> 00:17:55,440
Then we'll just use
more than one!

252
00:17:56,490 --> 00:18:03,160
GIGA DRILL MAXIMUM!

253
00:18:43,450 --> 00:18:45,620
Kinon? Are you okay?

254
00:18:45,870 --> 00:18:46,950
Kinon!

255
00:18:49,620 --> 00:18:53,630
Simon?
Yes, I'm all right...

256
00:18:53,840 --> 00:18:56,380
Damn, the big one's still alive...

257
00:18:57,130 --> 00:18:59,050
It's no use, I can't move...

258
00:18:59,930 --> 00:19:01,720
Damn it!

259
00:19:04,560 --> 00:19:06,430
Whew, made it
just in time!

260
00:19:06,520 --> 00:19:07,810
Is that Gimmy?

261
00:19:08,310 --> 00:19:11,810
Sorry to keep you waiting! Now, we'll
show you what the Grapearls can do!

262
00:19:12,150 --> 00:19:14,940
Let's do it!
Tornado Formation!

263
00:19:18,320 --> 00:19:20,650
Firing Spiral Bomber!

264
00:19:20,900 --> 00:19:22,950
Erecting Tornado Shield!

265
00:19:36,210 --> 00:19:38,000
It worked!
Ron, it worked!

266
00:19:38,210 --> 00:19:41,170
For adults, making it in time
is all part of the job.

267
00:19:42,720 --> 00:19:46,220
Kinon. I'm sorry.

268
00:19:51,390 --> 00:19:56,150
What we saw...
That wasn't the Nia I used to know.

269
00:20:06,660 --> 00:20:08,410
Your Core Drill, please.

270
00:20:19,170 --> 00:20:21,300
Gurren Lagann
will be scrapped.

271
00:20:21,510 --> 00:20:23,840
We will no longer rely on you.

272
00:20:25,300 --> 00:20:27,220
I understand.

273
00:20:32,020 --> 00:20:33,480
Simon!

274
00:20:39,520 --> 00:20:41,190
Simon!

275
00:20:41,360 --> 00:20:44,200
SIMON!

276
00:21:09,470 --> 00:21:11,260
Rossiu!

277
00:21:13,730 --> 00:21:18,060
You bastard, what do you think
you're doing to my sister?!

278
00:21:18,560 --> 00:21:22,070
The bomb you talked about, that was Kinon?!
Is that how you do things?

279
00:21:25,900 --> 00:21:28,030
You're gonna pay...

280
00:21:28,200 --> 00:21:31,330
You'll pay!

281
00:21:35,830 --> 00:21:37,790
Don't get the wrong idea, brother.

282
00:21:37,870 --> 00:21:41,340
The reason I volunteered to go, the reason
I said I would be a human bomb,

283
00:21:41,630 --> 00:21:44,010
...it was because I wanted
to be of use to Rossiu.

284
00:21:44,300 --> 00:21:45,760
Kinon...

285
00:21:46,050 --> 00:21:50,260
Brother, you don't know the
first thing about Rossiu.
