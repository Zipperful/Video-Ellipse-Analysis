00:00:10,670 --> 00:00:15,470
Gurren Lagann

2
00:00:15,470 --> 00:00:20,780
<font color=#FFFF00>Sugita kisetsu wo nageku hima ha nai
</font>I don't have the time to lament the seasons that have passed

3
00:00:20,780 --> 00:00:26,350
<font color=#FFFF00>Nido to mayotte shimawanu you ni
</font>So that I won't ever waver again

4
00:00:26,350 --> 00:00:31,660
<font color=#FFFF00>Kazoekirenai hon no sasayaka na
</font>With countless, tiny little

5
00:00:31,660 --> 00:00:36,560
<font color=#FFFF00>Sonna koukai kakaeta mama
</font>Regrets carried in my arms

6
00:00:36,660 --> 00:00:42,640
<font color=#FFFF00>Sono senaka dake oikakete koko made kitanda
</font>I've come this far, having chased only after your back

7
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:48,040
<font color=#FFFF00>Sagashite ita boku dake ni dekiru koto
</font>It's something only I, who sought you, can do

8
00:00:48,100 --> 00:00:53,110
<font color=#FFFF00>Ano hi kureta kotoba ga ima demo
</font>Those words you gave me that day, even now,

9
00:00:53,200 --> 00:00:58,940
<font color=#FFFF00>Kono mune ni tashika ni todoite iru kara
</font>Definitely reach my heart

10
00:00:59,050 --> 00:01:04,210
<font color=#FFFF00>Kinou yori mo kyou ha bu ha boku no
</font>I've realized my reason for having been born

11
00:01:04,250 --> 00:01:09,960
<font color=#FFFF00>Umarete kita wake ni kidzuite yuku
</font>Today more than I did yesterday

12
00:01:10,100 --> 00:01:18,830
<font color=#FFFF00>Kotae ha sou itsumo koko ni aru
</font>The answer, yes, is always right here

13
00:01:32,170 --> 00:01:36,590
This is the tale of a man who blows
a hole in the fate of a universe...

14
00:01:36,670 --> 00:01:39,180
...that is ruled by the endless
cycle of violence.

15
00:01:39,970 --> 00:01:44,260
The Super Galaxy Dai-Gurren sets sail to
put an end to the conflict once and for all.

16
00:01:44,890 --> 00:01:48,190
The men of Team Gurren are destroyed
one by one by the fierce attack...

17
00:01:48,270 --> 00:01:51,270
...of the enemy fleet, which was
lying in wait for them.

18
00:01:51,690 --> 00:01:54,940
Even the Super Galaxy Dai-Gurren,
hoping to turn the tables by transforming,

19
00:01:55,490 --> 00:01:58,950
...is swallowed up by a black sea
that unfolds in space,

20
00:01:59,030 --> 00:02:03,080
...and is about
to meet its end.

21
00:02:03,330 --> 00:02:09,080
<b>Episode 25:
I Accept Your Last Wish</b>

22
00:02:10,420 --> 00:02:12,500
The Super Galaxy Dai-Gurren
is sinking!

23
00:02:12,590 --> 00:02:16,090
Sinking?! We're in space!
What's an ocean doing in space?!

24
00:02:16,630 --> 00:02:19,840
The fabric of space-time is being
compressed until it's ultra-dense.

25
00:02:19,970 --> 00:02:22,010
That's why it
looks like water.

26
00:02:22,100 --> 00:02:24,050
Nothing makes sense anymore!

27
00:02:26,850 --> 00:02:27,930
Get us to the surface, Gabal!

28
00:02:28,060 --> 00:02:30,730
I can't! Engine output
isn't increasing!

29
00:02:35,610 --> 00:02:37,400
- Careful!
- Thank you.

30
00:02:37,820 --> 00:02:41,360
You must be getting soft, losing your
balance over a little rocking like this.

31
00:02:41,700 --> 00:02:45,830
Not to worry. It's all about filling
in the blanks with life experiences.

32
00:02:45,990 --> 00:02:48,580
- E-Experiences?!
- What's gotten into you?

33
00:02:48,790 --> 00:02:50,710
Nothing!

34
00:02:51,830 --> 00:02:55,000
I don't like the sound of that.
What the hell is going on out there?

35
00:02:58,670 --> 00:03:00,880
Enemy fleet is gathering
on the surface!

36
00:03:01,090 --> 00:03:02,630
Firing main guns!

37
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:04,340
Wait! The energy
will be--

38
00:03:13,520 --> 00:03:14,480
What happened?

39
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:16,150
Main guns' beams
have died out!

40
00:03:16,730 --> 00:03:19,150
The Spiral energy
was absorbed?

41
00:03:19,240 --> 00:03:20,610
But that's impossible!

42
00:03:20,780 --> 00:03:23,740
How could my beloved main
guns not work...?

43
00:03:23,870 --> 00:03:26,200
They NEVER work
when you use them!

44
00:03:26,280 --> 00:03:29,870
It would appear that this
is a Death Spiral Field.

45
00:03:30,290 --> 00:03:31,790
Death Spiral?

46
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:35,580
Spiral Energy is absorbed
and converted into mass.

47
00:03:36,090 --> 00:03:40,800
The more Spiral Power we use,
the denser this region becomes.

48
00:03:41,470 --> 00:03:43,590
Ah, so that's why
it looks like a sea.

49
00:03:43,720 --> 00:03:45,300
If we were to sink
into its depths,

50
00:03:45,430 --> 00:03:49,260
...not even the Super Galaxy
Dai-Gurren would survive.

51
00:03:49,350 --> 00:03:51,930
Meaning we'll be crushed flat
by the water pressure.

52
00:03:52,020 --> 00:03:53,770
No, the SPACE pressure...

53
00:03:54,060 --> 00:03:55,520
This can't be happening...

54
00:03:56,190 --> 00:03:58,320
Just leave it to me, Dayakka!

55
00:04:01,650 --> 00:04:06,160
The key is to rev up the engines faster
than the energy can be drained.

56
00:04:06,490 --> 00:04:08,370
Our power is limitless!

57
00:04:08,660 --> 00:04:10,540
Just as long as our hearts
don't give in!

58
00:04:11,080 --> 00:04:15,330
You're a man who spouts a bunch of crap.
But this is crap that I can get behind!

59
00:04:15,750 --> 00:04:17,540
Leave the fine-tuning to me!

60
00:04:29,180 --> 00:04:31,560
Damn it!

61
00:04:33,890 --> 00:04:35,520
Output is increasing!

62
00:04:35,850 --> 00:04:37,850
Raise the bow!
Take us up!

63
00:04:37,980 --> 00:04:39,060
That did the trick!

64
00:04:44,490 --> 00:04:48,160
Enemy units have entered the water
and are headed this way!

65
00:04:51,700 --> 00:04:52,490
Intercept them!

66
00:04:52,580 --> 00:04:54,540
Aretenborough!
Switch to physical ammo!

67
00:04:54,790 --> 00:04:56,000
You got it!

68
00:04:56,080 --> 00:04:58,040
Chew on this!

69
00:05:04,170 --> 00:05:05,590
The missiles are working!

70
00:05:05,720 --> 00:05:07,050
But there's too many!

71
00:05:18,020 --> 00:05:21,610
They're trying to force us
down to the bottom!

72
00:05:21,860 --> 00:05:24,320
Isn't there anything we can do
to shake them off?

73
00:05:29,570 --> 00:05:31,450
Aren't you scared?

74
00:05:32,290 --> 00:05:34,790
Aren't you afraid of dying?

75
00:05:34,910 --> 00:05:37,960
You'd be fighting a ton of enemies
in an ultra-dense region of space.

76
00:05:38,710 --> 00:05:42,420
How much fighting could you do
in your smashed-up Space King Kittan?

77
00:05:43,090 --> 00:05:45,590
How can you go out and fight,
knowing what might happen?

78
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:47,590
Gimmy, what're you--

79
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:49,380
It's no fair.

80
00:05:49,470 --> 00:05:53,430
I want to be like you and choose
to go out in a blaze of glory...

81
00:05:53,850 --> 00:05:56,980
But I just can't get
my body to move.

82
00:05:58,520 --> 00:05:59,900
Gimmy...

83
00:06:00,810 --> 00:06:03,230
What are you,
some kinda moron?

84
00:06:03,940 --> 00:06:06,820
Show me the person
who ain't afraid of dying!

85
00:06:07,110 --> 00:06:11,570
But I got no choice!
This is all I'm good at!

86
00:06:11,700 --> 00:06:14,030
We do this because
we WANT to!

87
00:06:14,120 --> 00:06:17,540
You gotta move forward, and that
goes double when you're scared!

88
00:06:19,460 --> 00:06:21,540
Basically, it's, you know...

89
00:06:21,880 --> 00:06:24,500
Aw, man, I can't
explain it right!

90
00:06:26,090 --> 00:06:27,460
I'll just say this.

91
00:06:28,300 --> 00:06:32,430
The reason Jorgun and Balinbow saved
you two is because they wanted to.

92
00:06:33,430 --> 00:06:36,140
So there's no reason for you
to feel like you owe them.

93
00:06:36,220 --> 00:06:37,390
Got it?

94
00:06:46,480 --> 00:06:49,400
I can't get the right words out...
Damn it.

95
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:51,200
You think?

96
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:54,990
If that guy was here, he would've done
a better job inspiring them.

97
00:06:55,490 --> 00:06:59,700
When he rallied the troops, his words
went straight to your heart.

98
00:07:00,120 --> 00:07:02,370
I really envy him
for that...

99
00:07:02,460 --> 00:07:04,170
"That guy"...

100
00:07:05,090 --> 00:07:10,720
I feel it even more as I get older.
Kamina was one hell of a man.

101
00:07:11,930 --> 00:07:13,720
You're overlooking something, Kittan.

102
00:07:14,390 --> 00:07:17,680
Team Dai-Gurren never would have
come this far if it weren't for you.

103
00:07:18,140 --> 00:07:22,020
Simon pulled us from above, and you
pushed and shoved us from below.

104
00:07:22,100 --> 00:07:26,190
That's how we managed to come
all this way. That's the way I see it.

105
00:07:29,240 --> 00:07:32,360
That's just as much a man's job
that you can be proud of, right?

106
00:07:34,490 --> 00:07:36,830
We're wasting time.
Let's do it!

107
00:07:53,510 --> 00:07:54,760
Is that Kittan?

108
00:07:55,090 --> 00:07:56,890
His Space King Kittan
works in this soup?

109
00:07:57,140 --> 00:08:00,100
Its Spiral Engine isn't its
only power source.

110
00:08:00,220 --> 00:08:03,560
They ran on electricity when we
were on the surface, remember?

111
00:08:03,850 --> 00:08:08,190
Oh, I get it! The Space Gunmen
have backup power sources, too!

112
00:08:14,450 --> 00:08:16,110
Look out!

113
00:08:16,910 --> 00:08:19,580
Don't mess with me!

114
00:08:21,040 --> 00:08:22,040
Are you okay?

115
00:08:22,410 --> 00:08:24,290
I lost an arm, that's all.

116
00:08:24,710 --> 00:08:26,210
It's no big deal.

117
00:08:26,330 --> 00:08:28,500
That was a rookie mistake.
Sorry.

118
00:08:29,130 --> 00:08:33,800
Don't sweat it. You fill in the blanks
with life experience, right?

119
00:08:34,590 --> 00:08:36,430
Man, these guys are coming
in swarms now...

120
00:08:38,260 --> 00:08:39,760
Hey, Yoko.

121
00:08:40,310 --> 00:08:43,980
When we get back to Earth, how about
introducing me to those kids of yours?

122
00:08:45,060 --> 00:08:48,480
I got a gruff exterior,
but I love kids.

123
00:08:48,900 --> 00:08:53,440
Once we waste these guys, take out
the Anti-Spiral, and go home to Earth,

124
00:08:53,780 --> 00:08:55,650
...that's when I'll--

125
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:02,950
Damn it, let me finish!

126
00:09:07,710 --> 00:09:08,830
Are you two okay?

127
00:09:09,170 --> 00:09:11,290
Show a little common sense,
why don't ya?

128
00:09:11,460 --> 00:09:14,800
Hey, we reject common sense to
make the impossible possible!

129
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:16,760
That's the way
Team Dai-Gurren rolls, right?

130
00:09:17,050 --> 00:09:17,930
Yeah, but--

131
00:09:18,010 --> 00:09:20,220
We're doing this
because we want to.

132
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:22,510
Please, let us
fight with you.

133
00:09:23,520 --> 00:09:27,020
Unbelievable... Kids and women,
I just can't say no to 'em.

134
00:09:27,770 --> 00:09:31,860
Okay, you three! We're gonna rip
those monsters off the ship!

135
00:09:31,980 --> 00:09:33,730
Roger!

136
00:09:35,530 --> 00:09:39,030
<font color=#FFC9B9>Gurren Lagann</font>

137
00:09:40,530 --> 00:09:44,040
<font color=#FFC9B9>Gurren Lagann</font>

138
00:09:50,500 --> 00:09:51,960
Okay, that's about all of 'em.

139
00:09:52,960 --> 00:09:54,460
Yoko! Look at that!

140
00:09:57,680 --> 00:09:59,430
Zooming in.

141
00:10:01,930 --> 00:10:03,720
Why, those are Laganns!

142
00:10:04,060 --> 00:10:06,220
What the hell's going on, Leeron?

143
00:10:06,560 --> 00:10:12,190
Those are Spiral warriors who once
faced the Anti-Spiral in battle.

144
00:10:12,570 --> 00:10:16,990
So this means that others besides us
made it this far?

145
00:10:17,190 --> 00:10:20,740
Indeed it does,
foolish people of the Spiral.

146
00:10:20,870 --> 00:10:24,120
Do not believe yourselves
to be special.

147
00:10:24,740 --> 00:10:29,710
In the battle between Spiral races and
Anti-Spiral that has crossed the eons,

148
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:33,960
...you are nothing more than
paltry, insignificant beings.

149
00:10:35,630 --> 00:10:40,300
Now, behold the history
of the Spiral races' defeat.

150
00:10:44,260 --> 00:10:49,770
You are in the Galactic Spiral Abyss.
The Spiral graveyard.

151
00:10:50,310 --> 00:10:52,980
High-order energy reading detected
from the deepest area.

152
00:10:53,520 --> 00:10:55,270
We're being slowly pulled in!

153
00:10:55,440 --> 00:11:00,450
The Death Spiral Machine.
That is what is generating this field.

154
00:11:00,660 --> 00:11:08,200
<b>Galactic Spiral Abyss</b>

155
00:11:00,990 --> 00:11:03,070
It's killed that many Laganns?

156
00:11:03,070 --> 00:11:08,200
This space ocean is where
the tears of the Spiral races end up...

157
00:11:08,700 --> 00:11:12,170
This is no time to get poetic!
We gotta do something!

158
00:11:13,170 --> 00:11:16,000
If this keeps up, the whole damn ship
is gonna be crushed!

159
00:11:16,250 --> 00:11:18,130
Don't give up, everybody!

160
00:11:18,590 --> 00:11:21,380
We won't let the Anti-Spiral
have things their way!

161
00:11:21,760 --> 00:11:23,640
Our dead friends...

162
00:11:24,050 --> 00:11:26,100
The Spiral races
that fell in battle...

163
00:11:26,510 --> 00:11:28,680
We'll take in
all their regrets.

164
00:11:29,020 --> 00:11:31,310
We'll take them in, and turn it
all into strength!

165
00:11:32,100 --> 00:11:37,070
We're not gonna let it end,
NOT HERE!

166
00:11:41,740 --> 00:11:43,740
Gabal, turn us around!

167
00:11:44,530 --> 00:11:46,450
Point the bow towards the core!

168
00:11:46,660 --> 00:11:47,660
What do you have in mind?

169
00:11:48,200 --> 00:11:52,660
What else? We'll fly down the Death
Spiral Machine's throat and destroy it!

170
00:11:53,170 --> 00:11:55,880
That's how Team Dai-Gurren rolls!

171
00:11:56,840 --> 00:12:01,460
He has a point. We've always
rolled the dice on Simon's drill.

172
00:12:02,680 --> 00:12:05,930
Up until now.
And from now on, too.

173
00:12:06,010 --> 00:12:07,140
Am I right?

174
00:12:09,430 --> 00:12:11,600
Gabal, bring us about
180 degrees, full speed!

175
00:12:11,810 --> 00:12:13,310
I'm on it!

176
00:12:31,080 --> 00:12:36,210
The Death Spiral Machine is surrounded
by a region of super-ultra-dense space.

177
00:12:36,960 --> 00:12:42,670
Even the Super Galaxy Dai-Gurren will
be lucky to survive 300 seconds within it.

178
00:12:43,090 --> 00:12:47,640
A Spiral conversion field
is in place around the machine.

179
00:12:47,930 --> 00:12:54,730
This field protects the machine by
converting mass into Spiral Power.

180
00:12:56,270 --> 00:12:59,940
It negates the pressure and generates
energy at the same time.

181
00:13:00,070 --> 00:13:01,570
Two birds with one stone...

182
00:13:01,900 --> 00:13:04,490
Still, that has a fatal flaw.

183
00:13:04,780 --> 00:13:08,280
A massive dose of Spiral Power
will disrupt that process,

184
00:13:08,870 --> 00:13:12,290
...and cause a localized
collapse of the field.

185
00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:16,120
We then lob in as many Spiral missiles
as we can into the gap.

186
00:13:16,420 --> 00:13:18,750
And that's the end
of the machine.

187
00:13:19,040 --> 00:13:21,130
Wow, it ain't as tough
as I expected!

188
00:13:21,340 --> 00:13:25,170
I guess it means that the Anti-Spiral
didn't anticipate that there would be...

189
00:13:25,260 --> 00:13:28,380
...people crazy enough to plunge
into this ultra-dense space.

190
00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:30,350
How are the Super Spiral
missiles coming?

191
00:13:30,600 --> 00:13:33,220
Simon is really running himself
into the ground in there.

192
00:13:33,270 --> 00:13:36,140
We'll be lucky to have two ready
by the time we get there.

193
00:13:36,390 --> 00:13:38,310
Two shots will be enough
to get the job done!

194
00:13:40,860 --> 00:13:41,860
What was that?

195
00:13:41,940 --> 00:13:45,030
There's flooding in block 5826!

196
00:13:46,450 --> 00:13:47,700
Flooding?

197
00:13:48,070 --> 00:13:50,910
We're taking on ultra-dense space!

198
00:13:50,990 --> 00:13:53,990
We're not flooding,
we're spacing!

199
00:13:54,370 --> 00:13:57,910
And block 280! And block 447!

200
00:13:58,080 --> 00:14:00,170
Block 2391, too!

201
00:14:00,290 --> 00:14:01,750
Close bulkheads!

202
00:14:02,170 --> 00:14:04,670
Don't let any more space
aboard the ship!

203
00:14:08,090 --> 00:14:10,180
The probability of this
operation's success is--

204
00:14:10,260 --> 00:14:13,890
You don't need to tell us.
We know it's crazy.

205
00:14:14,220 --> 00:14:17,520
We'll have five minutes to carry out
the operation once we enter firing range.

206
00:14:17,690 --> 00:14:21,100
If we take longer than that,
we'll be crushed as flat as a pancake.

207
00:14:21,270 --> 00:14:24,900
Tetukan, let Cybela handle things here.
Go give Leyte a hand.

208
00:14:25,030 --> 00:14:26,190
Understood.

209
00:14:34,870 --> 00:14:35,870
Simon!

210
00:14:37,450 --> 00:14:40,330
I can handle it.
Don't worry.

211
00:14:40,790 --> 00:14:43,840
Get it replaced ASAP!
We don't have much time!

212
00:14:44,300 --> 00:14:46,670
They're replacing the drill.
Get some rest.

213
00:14:47,130 --> 00:14:49,800
Okay, but just for a minute.

214
00:14:50,090 --> 00:14:54,510
I'm sorry, Simon.
If I had Spiral Power, I'd...

215
00:14:54,720 --> 00:14:55,930
Crap!

216
00:15:00,390 --> 00:15:02,440
What do you want,
you little pig-mole?

217
00:15:03,520 --> 00:15:05,610
You want me
to let you inside?

218
00:15:06,400 --> 00:15:07,610
All right, all right.

219
00:15:13,570 --> 00:15:15,950
What the--?
I can't believe it, you're--

220
00:15:32,090 --> 00:15:33,010
What happened?

221
00:15:33,390 --> 00:15:36,970
This little pig-mole is a
bundle of Spiral Power!

222
00:15:37,180 --> 00:15:39,720
Gurren and Lagann can now
operate in tandem!

223
00:15:40,100 --> 00:15:42,020
Boota! Keep it up!

224
00:15:42,140 --> 00:15:44,730
You're a Team Dai-Gurren
member, too!

225
00:15:48,730 --> 00:15:50,150
Boota has Spiral Power, too?

226
00:15:50,280 --> 00:15:53,740
Humans aren't the only
Spiral lifeforms.

227
00:15:53,820 --> 00:15:57,580
Perhaps it underwent a mutation.
Or is reacting to Simon's Spiral Power.

228
00:15:57,700 --> 00:16:02,370
In any event, it has stored up a massive
amount of Spiral Power within itself.

229
00:16:07,500 --> 00:16:10,170
Spacing aboard the ship
has grown more severe!

230
00:16:10,510 --> 00:16:16,430
Gate 589! Gate 3264!
Gate 779 destroyed!

231
00:16:16,600 --> 00:16:17,970
Gabal, hurry it up!

232
00:16:20,220 --> 00:16:21,560
What the hell are all these?

233
00:16:22,060 --> 00:16:23,940
Drills that we took off of
Gurren Lagann.

234
00:16:24,060 --> 00:16:24,940
They broke?

235
00:16:25,020 --> 00:16:27,810
Yeah. I've never seen
one break before.

236
00:16:27,900 --> 00:16:29,860
This is really taking
a toll on Simon, too.

237
00:16:30,400 --> 00:16:32,070
It is, huh?

238
00:16:32,440 --> 00:16:36,660
Approaching Death Spiral Machine.
Will enter firing range momentarily.

239
00:16:36,740 --> 00:16:37,950
That's what I've
been waiting for!

240
00:16:38,080 --> 00:16:39,660
What's the status on the
Super Spiral missiles?

241
00:16:40,290 --> 00:16:41,580
Ready to go.

242
00:16:44,500 --> 00:16:46,960
Enemy mechanism is now
within firing range!

243
00:16:47,420 --> 00:16:49,880
FIRE!

244
00:16:59,640 --> 00:17:01,060
It didn't reach?

245
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:03,810
But we ran strength calculations
for the missile casing!

246
00:17:03,890 --> 00:17:08,020
The density was even higher
than we calculated?

247
00:17:08,270 --> 00:17:10,610
Spacing is advancing.

248
00:17:10,690 --> 00:17:12,980
Time remaining, 4 minutes,
10 seconds.

249
00:17:13,780 --> 00:17:17,740
Leyte! Beef up the Super Spiral
missile casings! In one minute!

250
00:17:17,820 --> 00:17:19,530
Already on it!

251
00:17:22,790 --> 00:17:23,700
Leyte.

252
00:17:24,200 --> 00:17:27,370
Hold on there, Yoko.
This is MY job.

253
00:17:28,250 --> 00:17:32,460
Leyte, load the missile onto
my Space King Kittan.

254
00:17:32,550 --> 00:17:33,590
What?!

255
00:17:34,470 --> 00:17:37,590
In Dan-Gunmen mode,
its armor is really thick.

256
00:17:37,680 --> 00:17:39,430
We're short on time.

257
00:17:39,510 --> 00:17:43,100
It'll be faster and more reliable than
changing out the missile casings.

258
00:17:43,640 --> 00:17:45,980
That's what you had
in mind, right?

259
00:17:58,660 --> 00:18:01,700
Sorry. That's just me thinking
of myself, same as always.

260
00:18:09,210 --> 00:18:11,040
Thanks.

261
00:18:11,170 --> 00:18:13,250
You're doing this because
you want to, right?

262
00:18:13,380 --> 00:18:14,880
I can't stop you.

263
00:18:26,230 --> 00:18:30,270
I ain't gonna say some showy
crap like, "Later, buddy"!

264
00:18:31,060 --> 00:18:34,070
I'll be seeing ya soon,
you bozos!

265
00:18:40,320 --> 00:18:41,990
We're counting on you...

266
00:18:48,080 --> 00:18:51,830
That's it, huh?
Now, fire missile!

267
00:18:54,710 --> 00:18:57,210
Crap! Why'd they
have to bust NOW?

268
00:19:01,010 --> 00:19:03,640
Explosion confirmed inside
Spiral conversion field!

269
00:19:03,720 --> 00:19:04,600
Did he do it?

270
00:19:04,680 --> 00:19:07,390
No, the Death Spiral Machine
is still intact.

271
00:19:07,980 --> 00:19:09,100
Kittan...

272
00:19:09,770 --> 00:19:12,310
You died for nothing,
you dumb bastard...

273
00:19:12,600 --> 00:19:15,270
Not so fast! What's that
energy reading?

274
00:19:15,400 --> 00:19:19,440
From the size, it's... the Gunmen
that was inside the Space Gunmen!

275
00:19:21,780 --> 00:19:24,490
My King Kittan
is still doin' fine!

276
00:19:26,030 --> 00:19:29,450
I borrowed one of Gurren Lagann's
drills as a good luck charm!

277
00:19:30,250 --> 00:19:33,710
And I'm gonna put it
to good use!

278
00:19:34,080 --> 00:19:35,420
Kittan!

279
00:19:35,590 --> 00:19:37,630
This is Simon's soul!

280
00:19:37,920 --> 00:19:39,630
Team Dai-Gurren's soul!

281
00:19:39,880 --> 00:19:44,430
Humanity's soul!
No, it's MY soul!

282
00:19:44,800 --> 00:19:49,350
You think it's gonna be wiped out
by the likes of you?!

283
00:19:49,930 --> 00:19:53,060
Chew on this!

284
00:19:53,190 --> 00:20:04,110
KING KITTAN
GIGA DRILL BREAK!

285
00:20:07,910 --> 00:20:10,410
So this is the power
of the Spiral, huh?

286
00:20:10,750 --> 00:20:12,830
Okay, I'm impressed...

287
00:20:34,440 --> 00:20:37,900
This operation had a zero percent
chance of succeeding.

288
00:20:37,980 --> 00:20:42,070
But it seems that theoretical calculations
are pointless where you are concerned.

289
00:20:45,360 --> 00:20:46,740
What's happening?

290
00:20:47,240 --> 00:20:51,490
It's an immense... An unbelievably
immense Spiral energy reading...

291
00:20:51,790 --> 00:20:54,870
With the destruction of the
Death Spiral Machine,

292
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:59,000
...this dark sea is being converted
back into Spiral energy.

293
00:20:59,380 --> 00:21:01,000
It is the logical outcome.

294
00:21:01,090 --> 00:21:02,880
You should have mentioned that
before we got started!

295
00:21:02,970 --> 00:21:04,880
Our Super Spiral gauges
are climbing!

296
00:21:05,010 --> 00:21:07,430
Ten thousand! A hundred thousand!
One million!

297
00:21:07,720 --> 00:21:09,760
Simon, we're ready to go!

298
00:21:10,470 --> 00:21:13,470
Kittan... I accept your last wish.

299
00:21:16,810 --> 00:21:19,650
Viral. Boota.
Let's do this.

300
00:21:22,570 --> 00:21:23,780
Transform!

301
00:21:23,860 --> 00:21:27,070
That's what I've been
waiting to hear!

302
00:22:04,780 --> 00:22:07,610
