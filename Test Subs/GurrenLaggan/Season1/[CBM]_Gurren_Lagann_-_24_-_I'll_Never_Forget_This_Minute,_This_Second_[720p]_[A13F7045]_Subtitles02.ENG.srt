00:00:26,350 --> 00:00:31,660

7
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:48,040

10
00:00:59,050 --> 00:01:04,210

</font>The answer, yes, is always right here

13
00:01:33,710 --> 00:01:38,590
This is the tale of a man who blows
a hole in the fate of a universe...

14
00:01:38,720 --> 00:01:41,430
...that is ruled by the endless
cycle of violence.

15
00:01:42,100 --> 00:01:45,890
At long last, the location of the Anti-Spiral's
home planet has been discovered.

16
00:01:45,980 --> 00:01:50,600
The ring that Simon gave to Nia
was picked up by their Spiral scan.

17
00:01:50,690 --> 00:01:53,230
Indeed, if they travel there,
he will see Nia.

18
00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:55,070
To save the woman he loves,

00:01:55,190 --> 00:01:59,740
<b>Super Galaxy Dai-Gurren</b>

20
00:01:55,190 --> 00:01:57,900
to save the Earth on which his friends live,

21
00:01:57,900 --> 00:02:00,490
...and to put an end to the conflict once and for all,

22
00:02:00,570 --> 00:02:04,660
...the Super Galaxy Dai-Gurren sets sail,

...dimensional coordinates verified.

27
00:02:12,340 --> 00:02:15,550
Simon, focus your perception
on Nia.

28
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:20,880
I still can't believe it...

29
00:02:21,140 --> 00:02:23,970
The place where Nia is being held
is incredibly far away, right?

30
00:02:24,350 --> 00:02:26,640
Can we really use that thing
to jump to her?

31
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:29,600
All their talk goes way
over my head, too.

32
00:02:29,770 --> 00:02:32,060
But I guess I can understand it
if it boils down to...

33
00:02:32,230 --> 00:02:35,610
...Simon and Nia being connected by
feelings that transcend time and space.

34
00:02:36,150 --> 00:02:38,070
If you say so...

35
00:02:38,150 --> 00:02:42,070
I have confirmation.
Coordinate lock achieved.

36
00:02:42,200 --> 00:02:45,450
Okay, Simon! We're ready
to jump at any time!

37
00:02:46,240 --> 00:02:48,120

00:02:53,080 --> 00:02:55,340
I don't know what we'll find
waiting for us there,

00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,800

we can't afford to lose.

Can you believe this?
How far are we gonna go?

46
00:03:07,640 --> 00:03:10,270
- That's easy.
- As far as it takes.

47
00:03:10,390 --> 00:03:11,600
As far as it takes!

48
00:03:11,690 --> 00:03:13,940
Yeah, we go wherever

55
00:03:45,220 --> 00:03:47,640
This is where their

56
00:03:48,470 --> 00:03:50,720
There's a giant, naked lady
out there in space!

57
00:03:50,850 --> 00:03:52,270
Idiot, what are you talking--

58
00:04:05,660 --> 00:04:06,870
Nia!

59
00:04:09,910 --> 00:04:11,750
You came for me!

60
00:04:14,500 --> 00:04:16,710
Sure. I gave you my word,
didn't I?

61
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,210
I had faith that you would.

62
00:04:19,710 --> 00:04:22,380
Hang on,
I'll rescue you soon.

63
00:04:23,090 --> 00:04:25,800
So is that the real Nia?

64
00:04:25,930 --> 00:04:29,930
I don't see how. It looks like a holographic
projection or something like that.

65
00:04:30,270 --> 00:04:36,060
Be careful, Simon. The Anti-Spiral
are more powerful than you think.

66
00:04:36,230 --> 00:04:38,560
Don't worry about us.
I'll win, no matter what.

We'll win, and we'll all go
back to Earth together.

68
00:04:43,400 --> 00:04:44,570
Nia!

69
00:04:45,490 --> 00:04:48,570
- What's happening to her body?
- It's being analyzed.

70
00:04:48,830 --> 00:04:50,120
Being analyzed?

71
00:04:50,200 --> 00:04:53,870
Nia was born on Earth
and grew up among humans.

72
00:04:54,040 --> 00:04:58,380
Knowledge regarding Earth's humanity
is stored within her body.

73
00:04:58,540 --> 00:04:59,630
However...

74
00:05:01,590 --> 00:05:06,090
Why now? What need do they have to
analyze that information at this point?

75
00:05:06,430 --> 00:05:10,050
If what we're seeing is a projection,
where is the real Nia being kept?

76
00:05:10,140 --> 00:05:12,350
Let's try jumping again.

77
00:05:12,430 --> 00:05:15,270
This time, we'll go to
where the real Nia is!

78
00:05:25,030 --> 00:05:28,030
What the hell is this?
It's just like last time!

79
00:05:28,280 --> 00:05:33,660
Ah, now I understand. That fake Nia
is actively interfering with our jumps.

80
00:05:33,750 --> 00:05:36,160
Crap! One more time!

81
00:05:37,500 --> 00:05:40,290
Foolish people of the Spiral.

82
00:05:41,710 --> 00:05:43,840
- Who's there?!
- Anti-Spiral...

83
00:05:43,920 --> 00:05:45,760
That voice is them?

84
00:05:46,420 --> 00:05:47,590
Where is the voice
coming from?

85
00:05:47,720 --> 00:05:50,220
It's coming from
all directions simultaneously!

86
00:05:50,510 --> 00:05:52,140
How can that be?

87
00:05:53,430 --> 00:05:58,440
This is a malleable universe. They can
control it according to their every whim.

88
00:05:58,810 --> 00:06:03,230
It is no exaggeration to say that
our enemy is the universe itself.

89
00:06:04,690 --> 00:06:06,780
The universe itself...?

90
00:06:06,860 --> 00:06:09,320
You cling to the faintest
slivers of hope,

91
00:06:09,410 --> 00:06:12,660
...climbing up time and time again
from the precipice of despair.

92
00:06:12,910 --> 00:06:15,540
The foolishness of it all...

93
00:06:15,660 --> 00:06:17,660
But that is now at an end.

94
00:06:17,790 --> 00:06:22,750
Your last ember of hope will flicker
and go out when this girl vanishes.

95
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:31,090
If Nia disappears, it will no longer
be possible to track their homeworld.

96
00:06:31,340 --> 00:06:33,850
No way am I gonna
let them do that!

97
00:06:45,480 --> 00:06:46,530
It's huge...!

98
00:06:46,650 --> 00:06:49,780
Behold.
And learn.

99
00:06:49,860 --> 00:06:53,370
These are your absolute despair
given form.

100
00:06:53,620 --> 00:06:55,910
We don't know the meaning
of the word despair!

101
00:06:56,200 --> 00:06:57,080
Aretenborough!

102
00:06:57,160 --> 00:06:58,450
You got it!

103
00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:05,710
What was that?!

104
00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:07,340
An energy barrier.

105
00:07:07,420 --> 00:07:09,380
Just like the Mugann have.
Or even more powerful!

106
00:07:09,920 --> 00:07:11,800
Then we know what
we have to do!

107
00:07:11,930 --> 00:07:13,340
We're going out in
Arch-Gurren Lagann!

108
00:07:13,470 --> 00:07:14,510
Right.

109
00:07:15,050 --> 00:07:18,270
Geez, Leyte, when did you have time
to make these monsters?

110
00:07:18,390 --> 00:07:21,980
Super Galaxy Dai-Gurren's production
capacity is downright terrifying.

111
00:07:22,190 --> 00:07:24,310
You guys don't really
need me anymore.

112
00:07:24,440 --> 00:07:25,440
As if!

113
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:29,530
Nobody but you could've come up with
fighting something big with something big.

114
00:07:29,610 --> 00:07:32,860
Anyway, it's in your hands now.

115
00:07:32,990 --> 00:07:34,820
- Sure!
- Count on us.

116
00:07:35,320 --> 00:07:36,910
I'm counting on you,
too, darling.

117
00:07:44,210 --> 00:07:45,670
Activity detected
from enemy ships!

118
00:07:45,920 --> 00:07:49,500
Enemy ships are launching fighters!
There's a huge number of them!

119
00:07:49,630 --> 00:07:51,380
Ship count is... off the charts!

120
00:07:51,470 --> 00:07:54,380
Check it out! Enemy fighters
as far as the eye can see!

121
00:07:54,470 --> 00:07:58,260
Simon, we'll clear a path for you!
You can take it from there!

122
00:07:58,600 --> 00:07:59,560
Understood!

123
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:04,730
Okay, bozos, one last brawl! And I don't
wanna see anybody holding back!

124
00:08:05,060 --> 00:08:06,560
Of course not!

125
00:08:06,650 --> 00:08:10,570
I have kids waiting for me back home,
so I'm gonna give it everything I have!

126
00:08:10,740 --> 00:08:12,570
Y-You have kids?!

127
00:08:12,990 --> 00:08:15,320
Hey, when the hell
did you have kids?!

128
00:08:15,910 --> 00:08:18,530
A lady has to have
a few secrets, you know?

129
00:08:18,620 --> 00:08:20,200
S-Secrets?

130
00:08:20,700 --> 00:08:22,830
Contact with enemy formation
in 10 seconds!

131
00:08:23,330 --> 00:08:24,500
Right!

132
00:08:27,590 --> 00:08:28,880
Let's do it!

133
00:08:44,890 --> 00:08:48,480
There's a ton of these guys,
but they ain't so tough!

134
00:08:48,810 --> 00:08:52,650
We'll keep whittling them down.
Focus on attacking the enemy!

135
00:08:52,860 --> 00:08:54,150
Right!

136
00:08:55,030 --> 00:08:57,030
Now, Simon!
Hit it!

137
00:09:17,550 --> 00:09:19,840
This is bad! We can't
take much more of this!

138
00:09:20,100 --> 00:09:22,390
Hang in there!
We've almost got it!

139
00:09:25,060 --> 00:09:26,060
Crap!

140
00:09:26,140 --> 00:09:28,520
- Simon! Are you okay?!
- Yeah.

141
00:09:28,650 --> 00:09:30,520
Viral, let's give it
another shot!

142
00:09:30,940 --> 00:09:34,400
We were damaged pretty badly.
And that thing is just too big.

143
00:09:34,900 --> 00:09:36,530
This thing's drill
isn't enough!

144
00:09:36,820 --> 00:09:39,860
You mean we need an
even bigger drill?

145
00:09:39,990 --> 00:09:42,450
But where can we find
something like that?

146
00:09:44,580 --> 00:09:46,160
I know where there's one!

147
00:09:48,290 --> 00:09:49,540
Leyte?

148
00:09:49,880 --> 00:09:53,380
If you transform the Super Galaxy
Dai-Gurren into humanoid mode,

149
00:09:53,460 --> 00:09:54,750
...you'll be able to use its drills!

150
00:09:54,840 --> 00:09:55,710
Transform?

151
00:09:55,840 --> 00:09:56,970
Indeed.

152
00:09:57,090 --> 00:10:01,680
The human form is the one in which Spiral
Power is manifested most powerfully.

153
00:10:01,850 --> 00:10:04,970
If you transform Super Galaxy
Dai-Gurren into humanoid mode,

154
00:10:05,060 --> 00:10:07,810
...it will amplify our Spiral Power
tens of times over,

155
00:10:07,940 --> 00:10:12,980
...becoming a being which possesses
power rivaling that of a micro cosmos.

156
00:10:13,690 --> 00:10:15,610
In other words, Super Galaxy
Gurren Lagann, huh?

157
00:10:15,740 --> 00:10:17,570
It is not that simple.

158
00:10:17,700 --> 00:10:22,240
To transform so vast a vessel, it is necessary
to funnel similarly vast quantities...

159
00:10:22,330 --> 00:10:25,330
...of Spiral Power directly
into the main engine.

160
00:10:25,490 --> 00:10:29,370
At the moment, the only person
possessing sufficient Spiral Power--

161
00:10:30,330 --> 00:10:31,290
Is me, huh?

162
00:10:31,420 --> 00:10:34,040
Looks like we have
no other options.

163
00:10:34,130 --> 00:10:37,210
Looks that way.
Simon, leave these guys to us,

164
00:10:37,300 --> 00:10:40,260
...and you go transform Super Galaxy
Gurren Lagann ASAP.

165
00:10:40,550 --> 00:10:44,260
But are you guys gonna be okay
without Arch-Gurren Lagann?

166
00:10:47,060 --> 00:10:47,930
Kittan!

167
00:10:48,730 --> 00:10:52,440
Hey, now... Who the hell
do you think we are?

168
00:10:52,730 --> 00:10:54,690
We wanna do a little
grandstanding, too.

169
00:10:54,820 --> 00:10:56,320
We'll buy you the time
you need.

170
00:10:56,530 --> 00:10:58,190
You're gonna owe us one
for this, Simon.

171
00:10:58,360 --> 00:11:01,110
- Yeah! You owe us!
- You repay us soon!

172
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:08,120
I'll be right back with a huge drill.

173
00:11:08,410 --> 00:11:10,290
I'm counting on you, guys.

174
00:11:11,710 --> 00:11:15,170
Okay, it's time for Team Dai-Gurren
to take center stage!

175
00:11:15,250 --> 00:11:17,880
Listen up, bozos! Let's take 'em down
in serious style!

176
00:11:18,050 --> 00:11:19,760
Yeah!

177
00:11:21,180 --> 00:11:23,180
Wait for me, everybody...

Space Sunbeam!

181
00:11:44,740 --> 00:11:47,280
Damn it, they're having
all the fun!

182
00:11:51,330 --> 00:11:53,210
Gimmy, you're drifting in
too far.

183
00:11:53,500 --> 00:11:55,250
You're part of the
Grapearl Squadron!

184
00:11:55,460 --> 00:11:58,000
Aw, man...
Rear guard duty stinks.

185
00:11:58,170 --> 00:12:01,050
Maybe, but that's the job
we were assigned.

186
00:12:03,130 --> 00:12:05,720
Enemy battleship
has begun to move.

187
00:12:05,850 --> 00:12:07,800
It's advancing,
heading right for us.

188
00:12:07,890 --> 00:12:12,430
Now that she mentions it, it worries me
that those big things haven't attacked us.

189
00:12:12,560 --> 00:12:14,690
I wonder if they're part
of some kind of trap?

190
00:12:15,190 --> 00:12:18,440
Fall back! For the time being,
maintain our distance!

191
00:12:18,610 --> 00:12:21,900
<b>Inside Super Galaxy Dai-Gurren,
Ultra Spiral Powerplant</b>

192
00:12:19,610 --> 00:12:21,900
Concentrate on charging up our Spiral energy!

193
00:12:22,400 --> 00:12:24,490
<b>Inside Arch-Gurren Lagann,
Ultra Spiral Powerplant</b>

194
00:12:25,030 --> 00:12:29,030
<b>Inside Gurren Lagann,
Ultra Spiral Powerplant (Simon)</b>

195
00:12:25,030 --> 00:12:27,160
Leyte, how much longer?

196
00:12:27,660 --> 00:12:30,290
Transformation will be possible with another 48%.

197
00:12:30,870 --> 00:12:32,870
Another ten minutes
or so.

198
00:12:33,540 --> 00:12:35,710
I'll make sure everything is ready
on this end before then.

199
00:12:35,830 --> 00:12:36,620
Understood.

200
00:12:36,960 --> 00:12:38,250
Keep your cool.

201
00:12:38,340 --> 00:12:41,920
But even I can see now that your
Spiral Power is off the charts.

202
00:12:42,550 --> 00:12:44,720
You're one impressive specimen.

203
00:12:45,800 --> 00:12:48,220
Still, I have a bad feeling
about this somehow.

204
00:12:48,600 --> 00:12:50,720
What's this vibe I'm getting?

205
00:12:55,730 --> 00:12:57,310
Kittan!
Hey, Kittan!

206
00:12:58,060 --> 00:12:59,190
What's up, Yoko?

207
00:12:59,610 --> 00:13:03,110
Doesn't this seem strange to you?
These guys are just too weak!

208
00:13:03,320 --> 00:13:06,910
Come on, it just means that
WE are just too badass!

209
00:13:09,910 --> 00:13:11,660
Splash number 108!

210
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:14,120
What's this?
Form up?

211
00:13:14,250 --> 00:13:18,120
Gimmy! There's the rally signal!
Let's head back to the Dai-Gurren.

212
00:13:18,380 --> 00:13:21,590
Form up, huh?
Damn, things were just getting good...

213
00:13:29,350 --> 00:13:30,680
What the hell?!

214
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:32,430
What?!

215
00:13:35,140 --> 00:13:38,140
What's up with these guys?
They got fast and agile all of a sudden--

216
00:13:38,270 --> 00:13:40,560
They were faking it!

217
00:13:49,070 --> 00:13:52,160
Those Grapearls can't handle 'em!
We'll provide cover!

218
00:13:52,830 --> 00:13:55,580
Grapearl Squadron, return to
the Super Galaxy Dai-Gurren!

219
00:13:55,660 --> 00:13:58,290
Kittan! Zorthy's gotten
himself into trouble.

220
00:13:58,420 --> 00:13:59,920
Kid and I are gonna
go rescue him.

221
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:03,460
Dumbass! Weren't you listening?!
We're supposed to fall back!

222
00:14:03,550 --> 00:14:05,210
You want us to abandon him?!

223
00:14:05,920 --> 00:14:07,470
All right, I'll come with you!

224
00:14:08,010 --> 00:14:09,050
Wait a minute, Kittan!

225
00:14:09,130 --> 00:14:11,970
Hey, now.
This is OUR job.

226
00:14:12,050 --> 00:14:14,890
Yours is to look after
the rookies, right?

227
00:14:15,140 --> 00:14:16,390
Iraak!

228
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:18,940
You heard the man.
We'll leave you to it.

229
00:14:19,060 --> 00:14:20,400
- See ya!
- Kid!

230
00:14:20,690 --> 00:14:22,650
Crap! You better come back,
you hear me?!

231
00:14:22,940 --> 00:14:25,650
'Cuz if you don't,
I'm gonna kick your ass!

232
00:14:27,240 --> 00:14:30,200
Yoko! Makken!
Jorgun, Balinbow!

233
00:14:30,820 --> 00:14:33,370
We'll follow the Grapearls
and cover their backs!

234
00:14:34,580 --> 00:14:37,620
Damn it...
Get off me, bastard!

235
00:14:40,620 --> 00:14:43,670
Son of a bitch!

236
00:14:43,790 --> 00:14:47,510
Zorthy! We're on our way!
Hold out for a little bit longer!

237
00:14:47,630 --> 00:14:48,550
Kid!

238
00:14:49,380 --> 00:14:53,090
I'm in trouble here. My ejection
system ain't working, either.

239
00:14:55,890 --> 00:14:57,890
I came a long way,
didn't I?

240
00:14:58,270 --> 00:14:59,180
Zorthy!

241
00:15:04,570 --> 00:15:08,150
You bastards!

242
00:15:22,710 --> 00:15:26,090
Multiple high-temp thermal signatures have
been launched from the enemy battleships.

243
00:15:26,170 --> 00:15:27,960
Predicted target is this vessel!

244
00:15:28,420 --> 00:15:29,260
How many?!

245
00:15:29,630 --> 00:15:30,970
Thirteen in total!

246
00:15:31,510 --> 00:15:33,970
Lordgenome! Do we have any
interceptor missiles?

247
00:15:34,140 --> 00:15:35,300
Of course.

248
00:15:35,430 --> 00:15:36,390
Aretenborough!

249
00:15:36,470 --> 00:15:39,180
You got it!
All missiles, fire!

250
00:15:41,230 --> 00:15:42,390
Missiles?!

251
00:15:42,520 --> 00:15:45,560
Darry! We're gonna shoot down anything
that gets through our flak curtain!

252
00:15:46,070 --> 00:15:47,320
Roger!

253
00:15:47,900 --> 00:15:51,490
Thermal signatures now making
contact with interceptor missiles!

254
00:15:57,160 --> 00:15:58,410
How many did we get?

255
00:15:58,490 --> 00:16:00,330
Half of them!
Six are left!

256
00:16:00,410 --> 00:16:01,750
Leave the rest to us!

257
00:16:03,870 --> 00:16:05,120
Four left!

258
00:16:24,350 --> 00:16:27,230
Sorry, Kid.
I'm outta ammo over here.

259
00:16:27,400 --> 00:16:30,480
Yeah, same here. Guess we're
in sync right to the very end...

260
00:16:37,530 --> 00:16:38,740
Simon!

261
00:16:39,660 --> 00:16:42,410
There's a lady waiting for you,
so don't break her heart.

262
00:16:42,540 --> 00:16:43,620
That you, Iraak?

263
00:16:43,750 --> 00:16:44,750
Simon.

264
00:16:45,620 --> 00:16:47,750
Get Nia back, you hear?

265
00:16:47,880 --> 00:16:48,920
Kid...

266
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:50,920
One last fight, partner.

267
00:16:52,210 --> 00:16:53,840
Let's show 'em...

268
00:16:53,920 --> 00:16:56,180
...that Team Gurren
never gives in!

269
00:16:56,760 --> 00:16:58,800
Kid! Iraak!

270
00:17:05,560 --> 00:17:09,860
Selfish bastards went and
bought it without us...

271
00:17:10,270 --> 00:17:12,730
Giant missile reading detected
coming through a warp gate!

272
00:17:12,820 --> 00:17:16,030
We're not gonna let 'em have
things their way anymore.

273
00:17:22,870 --> 00:17:24,580
- Oh, no!
- It's too close!

274
00:17:37,050 --> 00:17:38,470
Second missile inbound!

275
00:17:42,350 --> 00:17:44,470
Darry! You're too close
to take the shot!

276
00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:46,850
But I have to take it down!

277
00:17:51,480 --> 00:17:52,900
Darry!

278
00:17:56,780 --> 00:17:59,030
Another gate reading,
this time from the port stern!

279
00:17:59,280 --> 00:18:00,990
From the opposite side this time?!
Take evasive action!

280
00:18:01,370 --> 00:18:02,830
There's not enough time!

281
00:18:18,930 --> 00:18:20,590
We made it?

282
00:18:20,760 --> 00:18:21,890
By our defensive shield?

283
00:18:22,140 --> 00:18:25,560
Yes. But it could not have
handled a direct hit.

284
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:29,060
Someone must have
rammed the missile.

285
00:18:29,190 --> 00:18:30,650
It was Makken.

286
00:18:32,940 --> 00:18:36,940
I picked up Mo-Shogun's signal
at the very last second.

287
00:18:38,150 --> 00:18:39,530
Makken...

288
00:18:40,200 --> 00:18:41,820
Darling...

289
00:18:44,120 --> 00:18:47,450
Spiral energy charge is at 95%!
Get ready, everybody!

290
00:18:53,880 --> 00:18:56,090
- Darry, are you okay?
- Gimmy?

291
00:19:03,890 --> 00:19:05,680
We're going back to the
Dai-Gurren together!

292
00:19:05,890 --> 00:19:08,390
Gimmy, you'll never make it back
if you're towing me!

293
00:19:08,600 --> 00:19:09,640
Run by yourself!

294
00:19:09,730 --> 00:19:12,560
Dumbass! I can't do that,
and you know it!

295
00:19:17,900 --> 00:19:19,400
Damn it...

296
00:19:22,030 --> 00:19:23,990
- Gimmy! Darry!
- You okay?!

297
00:19:24,240 --> 00:19:26,240
Jorgun! Balinbow!

298
00:19:27,040 --> 00:19:28,870
Okay, now we go home!

299
00:19:36,880 --> 00:19:39,630
This isn't good...
We won't last all the way back!

300
00:19:40,050 --> 00:19:43,890
It all right, our Twinboekun
is as tough as it gets!

301
00:19:44,260 --> 00:19:45,550
I see ship!

302
00:19:46,600 --> 00:19:48,310
You're right!

303
00:19:51,060 --> 00:19:52,310
What do you think
you're doing?!

304
00:19:54,560 --> 00:19:56,440
Gimmy! You protect Darry!

305
00:19:56,570 --> 00:19:58,480
You live well!
Enough for us, too!

306
00:19:58,940 --> 00:20:01,110
Jorgun! Balinbow!

307
00:20:52,330 --> 00:20:53,750
I'll never forget.

308
00:20:54,330 --> 00:20:58,880
I will never forget
this minute, this second...

309
00:21:10,850 --> 00:21:12,850
Threshold achieved.

310
00:21:21,150 --> 00:21:23,570
That did it, Simon!
Begin transformation!

311
00:21:31,240 --> 00:21:33,910
Gravity field emanating
off the port side!

312
00:21:34,330 --> 00:21:37,580
- What in the world is that wall?
- I'm not picking up anything on radar!

313
00:21:47,220 --> 00:21:49,590
- How can there be a sea in space?!
- How can this be?

314
00:21:50,050 --> 00:21:52,600
Our energy!
Simon, we're in trouble!

315
00:21:52,720 --> 00:21:55,020
Get us out of it!
Dayakka, hurry!

316
00:21:55,390 --> 00:21:57,480
It's no use!
We don't have enough power!

317
00:21:57,560 --> 00:21:59,600
The Spiral gauge
is falling steadily!

318
00:21:59,730 --> 00:22:00,770
What?!

319
00:22:00,940 --> 00:22:04,730
It is a trap.
We walked right into it?
