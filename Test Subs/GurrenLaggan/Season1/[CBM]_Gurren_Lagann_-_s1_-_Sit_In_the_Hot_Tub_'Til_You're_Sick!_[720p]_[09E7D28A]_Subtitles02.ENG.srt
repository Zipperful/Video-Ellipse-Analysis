1
00:00:10,670 --> 00:00:15,510
Gurren Lagann

2
00:00:15,580 --> 00:00:18,110
<font color=#FFFF00>Kimi ha kikoeru?
</font>Can you hear it?

3
00:00:18,250 --> 00:00:26,250
<font color=#FFFF00>Boku no kono koe ga yami ni munashiku suikomareta
</font>This voice of mine was sucked emptily into darkness

4
00:00:26,600 --> 00:00:31,700
<font color=#FFFF00>Moshimo sekai ga imi wo motsu no nara
</font>If the world has meaning to it,

5
00:00:32,030 --> 00:00:36,570
<font color=#FFFF00>Konna kimochi mo muda de ha nai
</font>Then these kinds of feelings aren't futile

6
00:00:36,910 --> 00:00:42,610
<font color=#FFFF00>Akogare ni oshitsubusarete akirametetanda
</font>I was crushed by my longing and had given up

7
00:00:42,910 --> 00:00:47,870
<font color=#FFFF00>Hateshinai sora no iro mo shiranaide
</font>Without even knowing the color of the endless sky

8
00:00:48,280 --> 00:00:53,190
<font color=#FFFF00>Hashiridashita omoi ga ima demo
</font>I began to run, because my feelings, even now,

9
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:58,960
<font color=#FFFF00>Kono mune wo tashika ni tataiteru kara
</font>Are definitely beating against my heart

10
00:00:59,230 --> 00:01:04,030
<font color=#FFFF00>Kyou no boku ga sono saki ni tsudzuku
</font>The me of today will continue towards our destination

11
00:01:04,500 --> 00:01:10,060
<font color=#FFFF00>Bokura nari no asu wo kizuite yuku
</font>We'll amass our own tomorrows

12
00:01:10,410 --> 00:01:18,900
<font color=#FFFF00>Kotae ha sou itsumo koko ni aru
</font>The answer, yes, is always right here

13
00:01:31,540 --> 00:01:34,300
- Boy, that was one nasty experience...
- What was?

14
00:01:34,420 --> 00:01:36,420
That village, Adai.

15
00:01:36,550 --> 00:01:41,010
It's a gloomy village full of gloomy
people living in the gloomy cold.

16
00:01:41,470 --> 00:01:44,930
Whenever I think back to that place,
I get ticked off somehow.

17
00:01:45,060 --> 00:01:47,140
Yeah, they were really
poor there, weren't they?

18
00:01:47,640 --> 00:01:52,360
I thought to myself, back in Giha Village,
we had it a lot better than those people do.

19
00:01:52,570 --> 00:01:54,900
We had electricity, and we
also had pig-moles.

20
00:01:54,980 --> 00:01:56,280
That's for sure.

21
00:01:56,400 --> 00:01:58,700
They drink some kinda
soup or broth...

22
00:01:58,820 --> 00:02:01,450
...made outta something that might
or not be some kinda fish.

23
00:02:01,530 --> 00:02:05,620
When kids eat stuff like that, they grow
into gloomy kids like Forehead Boy.

24
00:02:05,750 --> 00:02:08,210
I understand Rossiu, though.

25
00:02:08,290 --> 00:02:11,210
You understand why he has such
a big forehead at his young age?

26
00:02:11,460 --> 00:02:13,130
I don't know about that.

27
00:02:13,250 --> 00:02:18,880
But if I hadn't met you...
If I'd been born in that village...

28
00:02:19,430 --> 00:02:21,220
...I might have
turned out like that.

29
00:02:21,390 --> 00:02:24,850
You're right. You've got an
oversized forehead, too.

30
00:02:25,140 --> 00:02:26,930
Could we please drop
the forehead thing?

31
00:02:27,430 --> 00:02:31,060
Why did you try so hard to push
the High Priest's buttons?

32
00:02:31,150 --> 00:02:35,230
Oh, that. Something about him
reminded me of our village chief.

33
00:02:35,570 --> 00:02:39,150
Besides, that whole "worship Gunmen
as gods" thing really pisses me off.

34
00:02:39,650 --> 00:02:41,240
Yeah, this is the guy!

35
00:02:41,570 --> 00:02:44,320
Look! It's hard to tell
which one is the Gunmen!

36
00:02:44,410 --> 00:02:46,660
Having more lines on your face isn't
necessarily a good thing, you know?

37
00:02:46,740 --> 00:02:48,500
I wish you'd talk sense...

38
00:02:48,910 --> 00:02:52,370
I bet it was rough for him. The village
didn't have much food or water.

39
00:02:52,920 --> 00:02:56,130
To survive, don't you think he had
to find something to hold on to?

40
00:02:56,300 --> 00:02:57,710
That's not it.

41
00:02:58,510 --> 00:03:02,550
That Father Magin guy... He had
enough spirit to operate a Gunmen.

42
00:03:03,050 --> 00:03:07,060
He had enough spirit to fight that
Gunmen that came down after us.

43
00:03:07,470 --> 00:03:09,520
He should have put that
to good use!

44
00:03:10,140 --> 00:03:13,310
Just because there's only enough
food for 50 down there...

45
00:03:13,400 --> 00:03:15,770
...don't make it right to exile
any extra people to the surface!

46
00:03:16,110 --> 00:03:18,150
He even rigged the lottery
to make sure that...

47
00:03:18,230 --> 00:03:21,150
...a couple of kids like Gimmy
and Darry got picked!

48
00:03:21,610 --> 00:03:24,450
I can't condone crap
like that, not ever.

49
00:03:26,160 --> 00:03:30,410
Tell me, Simon. You know why
people have eyes in front?

50
00:03:31,370 --> 00:03:35,210
It's 'cause you have to move forward
to see the landscape in the distance.

51
00:03:36,040 --> 00:03:38,000
Move... forward.

52
00:03:38,090 --> 00:03:39,500
Yeah, that's right.

53
00:03:40,300 --> 00:03:44,470
If you have eyes in back, all you can see
is your hometown getting farther away.

54
00:03:44,930 --> 00:03:47,390
You can't move forward
like that.

55
00:03:47,970 --> 00:03:52,390
If your eyes are in front, what you see
in the distance keeps getting closer.

56
00:03:52,850 --> 00:03:54,730
That's what lets people
move forward.

57
00:03:55,310 --> 00:03:58,270
My dear departed dad
used to say that all the time.

58
00:03:58,570 --> 00:04:00,940
What you see
off in the distance...

59
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:03,150
Yeah, that's right.

60
00:04:03,450 --> 00:04:05,910
But that's not all of it.

61
00:04:05,990 --> 00:04:09,530
Having eyes in front also lets you see the
backs of the people walking ahead of you.

62
00:04:09,700 --> 00:04:10,790
Simon?

63
00:04:10,870 --> 00:04:14,920
That's why Rossiu came with us.
That's what I think.

64
00:04:15,080 --> 00:04:18,840
Let's show them all. Let's show
Rossiu and Gimmy. And Darry.

65
00:04:19,130 --> 00:04:22,170
All our new friends.
Let's show them new scenery.

66
00:04:22,380 --> 00:04:24,220
Yeah, you're right.

67
00:04:24,590 --> 00:04:27,590
Finding new friends
ain't bad at all.

68
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:35,440
Episode 6:
Sit In the Hot Tub 'Til You're Sick!

69
00:04:35,940 --> 00:04:39,610
I don't see anything around here
that seems like a likely candidate.

70
00:04:39,650 --> 00:04:40,940
No doubt about it.

71
00:04:41,230 --> 00:04:44,490
Judging from this map, the recall
point ought to be right here.

72
00:04:44,780 --> 00:04:47,240
Are you sure
we didn't pass it?

73
00:04:47,320 --> 00:04:53,330
It's hard to believe that we could overlook
a facility large enough to launch Gunmen.

74
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:57,750
I suppose I need to look over
Gurren's data one more time.

75
00:04:58,210 --> 00:04:59,040
Huh?

76
00:04:59,170 --> 00:05:00,090
What's wrong?

77
00:05:00,210 --> 00:05:01,630
It's moving.

78
00:05:01,710 --> 00:05:03,840
- Moving?
- How is that possible?

79
00:05:04,300 --> 00:05:06,970
Beats me. But judging
from the data,

80
00:05:07,090 --> 00:05:10,600
...it would mean that the recall
point itself is moving.

81
00:05:10,760 --> 00:05:12,720
Is that even possible?

82
00:05:12,850 --> 00:05:17,890
I haven't the slightest. It might mean
that this data isn't reliable.

83
00:05:18,520 --> 00:05:20,060
Damn thing is useless!

84
00:05:20,520 --> 00:05:22,480
Huh? What're you doing?

85
00:05:23,230 --> 00:05:24,740
Point your face
somewhere else!

86
00:05:24,820 --> 00:05:27,740
Huh? What? I can't hear
a word you're saying!

87
00:05:28,030 --> 00:05:28,950
What's the matter?

88
00:05:29,160 --> 00:05:31,120
Are you feeling ill?

89
00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:33,490
It stinks!

90
00:05:35,660 --> 00:05:36,460
Stinks?

91
00:05:36,580 --> 00:05:38,460
What stinks?
Where?

92
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:43,050
You guys reek
to high heaven!

93
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:48,970
Try brushing your teeth and washing up
every once in a while, damn it!

94
00:05:54,140 --> 00:05:55,560
It's some Gunmen!

95
00:06:02,480 --> 00:06:04,400
You out there in the Gunmen!

96
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:09,200
Listen and be amazed!
Look and be amazed!

97
00:06:09,320 --> 00:06:13,410
My angry flames burn to ash any Gunmen
brazen enough to cross my path!

98
00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:20,830
You face the mighty Kamina, indomitable
leader of the invincible Team Gurren!

99
00:06:21,130 --> 00:06:24,630
Geez, can't he fight without
running his mouth off?

100
00:06:25,050 --> 00:06:29,130
Come at me
however you want!

101
00:06:30,590 --> 00:06:32,140
They hardly put up
a fight at all!

102
00:06:32,220 --> 00:06:34,720
Is it just me, or are these
Gunmen getting weaker?

103
00:06:34,850 --> 00:06:35,970
Awesome! Awesome!

104
00:06:44,820 --> 00:06:48,570
I think it means that
we're getting tougher.

105
00:06:48,650 --> 00:06:50,320
Right, Simon?

106
00:06:50,450 --> 00:06:52,160
Y-You really think so?

107
00:06:52,280 --> 00:06:54,950
Wait a minute.
One of them is getting away.

108
00:06:55,080 --> 00:06:56,910
Yeah, let's kill 'em all!

109
00:06:57,040 --> 00:07:00,330
Kamina, do you suppose we might
arrive at the recall point...

110
00:07:00,420 --> 00:07:03,170
...if we follow that
fleeing Gunmen?

111
00:07:05,960 --> 00:07:07,380
That's it!

112
00:07:08,550 --> 00:07:11,880
Come back here, you long-eared
Gunmen varmint!

113
00:07:17,470 --> 00:07:20,060
Crap, where did it go?!

114
00:07:21,190 --> 00:07:22,940
It's hopeless in this fog.

115
00:07:23,020 --> 00:07:25,560
Hey! Bro!
Something's out there!

116
00:07:25,690 --> 00:07:26,860
A Gunmen?

117
00:07:26,940 --> 00:07:29,530
No, it's too small.

118
00:07:39,330 --> 00:07:42,460
What're you doing
out here, Gramps?

119
00:07:44,540 --> 00:07:46,380
Do you think he can
understand us?

120
00:07:46,460 --> 00:07:49,250
I wonder if there's a village
somewhere around here.

121
00:07:51,630 --> 00:07:53,340
You want us
to go that way?

122
00:07:59,640 --> 00:08:03,060
Hey, pops! What's out here
in the mountains?

123
00:08:03,140 --> 00:08:06,350
Huh? I can see something
up ahead, Bro.

124
00:08:21,040 --> 00:08:23,710
This building is blatantly suspicious.

125
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:27,170
The air is warm.
And it's giving off steam.

126
00:08:27,540 --> 00:08:31,630
Everyone, we've delivered the old man
safely, so we should leave, and--

127
00:08:31,760 --> 00:08:33,340
You are going inside?

128
00:08:33,630 --> 00:08:36,300
Well, he seems to want us
to follow him!

129
00:08:36,390 --> 00:08:39,510
Maybe he's gonna give us
a reward or something.

130
00:08:43,140 --> 00:08:45,600
Welcome!

131
00:08:46,310 --> 00:08:48,310
This is getting more
and more suspicious.

132
00:08:48,400 --> 00:08:51,020
Something fishy is going on!
Trust me!

133
00:08:53,070 --> 00:08:55,200
Well, well, if it isn't
the mighty Kamina.

134
00:08:56,070 --> 00:08:59,030
"How do you know who I am?"
you are about to ask?

135
00:09:00,450 --> 00:09:04,960
There isn't a single human on the surface
who hasn't heard of Team Gurren.

136
00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:05,960
Not a one!

137
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:10,920
Your many exploits have given hope
and courage to villagers far and wide,

138
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:12,750
...prompting them to take
to the surface themselves.

139
00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:15,420
You are the hero of the
entire human race!

140
00:09:15,590 --> 00:09:16,800
You're our hero!

141
00:09:16,930 --> 00:09:17,970
Moron.

142
00:09:18,090 --> 00:09:19,090
Gimmy, you too?

143
00:09:19,180 --> 00:09:22,470
You ladies and gentlemen
by the door, please, join us.

144
00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:25,430
Come in, come in!

145
00:09:29,400 --> 00:09:30,980
This is so fishy!

146
00:09:31,110 --> 00:09:33,900
It may look delicious in one sense,
but in another,

147
00:09:33,990 --> 00:09:37,530
...it might contain poison so deadly
it can kill with a single--

148
00:09:37,910 --> 00:09:38,780
Hey, Rossiu!

149
00:09:38,860 --> 00:09:40,740
You've already eaten
9/10ths of it...

150
00:09:40,830 --> 00:09:44,790
Yeah, and if you don't hurry up,
I'm gonna eat the tenth that's left!

151
00:09:45,160 --> 00:09:47,080
A man's stomach knows no limits!

152
00:09:47,160 --> 00:09:49,460
Keep it coming!

153
00:09:49,750 --> 00:09:51,750
How manly!

154
00:09:59,930 --> 00:10:01,180
Is this safe?

155
00:10:02,010 --> 00:10:03,470
Oh, my!

156
00:10:03,640 --> 00:10:05,100
Kamina!

157
00:10:05,350 --> 00:10:06,640
I knew it, it's Kamina!

158
00:10:06,730 --> 00:10:07,980
- I missed you so!
- Um, who are you?

159
00:10:08,060 --> 00:10:11,770
Don't you remember? We're the
three sisters of the Black Siblings.

160
00:10:12,690 --> 00:10:13,980
Friends of yours?

161
00:10:14,070 --> 00:10:15,030
Yeah.

162
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:21,240
Yoko, when did you
have kids?

163
00:10:22,620 --> 00:10:24,160
No way!
Did you and Kamina--

164
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:25,790
As if!

165
00:10:25,870 --> 00:10:27,950
Come to think of it,
where's Kittan?

166
00:10:28,500 --> 00:10:33,000
He had some things to take care of.
We're on our own today.

167
00:10:34,130 --> 00:10:39,130
Actually, we were waiting for him near here,
but then some Gunmen showed up.

168
00:10:39,970 --> 00:10:43,760
Yes, that's right! And then while
we were chasing them,

169
00:10:43,890 --> 00:10:48,270
...this odd haze sprang up,
and just when we got lost--

170
00:10:48,600 --> 00:10:51,900
You were guided here
by a mysterious old man?

171
00:10:52,230 --> 00:10:53,520
Right!

172
00:10:59,030 --> 00:11:01,360
So... Who are you?

173
00:11:04,450 --> 00:11:06,870
Ladies and gentlemen,
once you have eaten your fill,

174
00:11:06,950 --> 00:11:11,290
...feel free to soak away your battle
fatigue in our prized hot spring.

175
00:11:11,500 --> 00:11:12,500
Hot spring?!

176
00:11:12,630 --> 00:11:15,000
Hot spring?
What the hell is that?

177
00:11:15,460 --> 00:11:18,210
You see, hon, a hot spring
is a place where--

178
00:11:23,260 --> 00:11:26,010
This is awesome...
Totally awesome!

179
00:11:26,140 --> 00:11:28,350
Take your time
and enjoy yourselves!

180
00:11:28,430 --> 00:11:31,560
- This hits the spot!
- This feels so wonderful!

181
00:11:36,610 --> 00:11:38,980
Bro, where are Rossiu and Ron?

182
00:11:39,070 --> 00:11:40,490
Don't know, don't care.

183
00:11:48,540 --> 00:11:52,040
<font color=#FFC9B9>Gurren Lagann</font>

184
00:11:53,540 --> 00:11:57,040
<font color=#FFC9B9>Gurren Lagann</font>

185
00:12:04,390 --> 00:12:08,510
This hot spring is great...
Right, Bro?

186
00:12:09,220 --> 00:12:10,470
Hey, Simon?

187
00:12:10,600 --> 00:12:12,180
Yeah, what?

188
00:12:12,310 --> 00:12:16,480
One of these days, you and me
need to try to go to the moon.

189
00:12:16,520 --> 00:12:18,610
Moon?
You mean this?

190
00:12:18,690 --> 00:12:20,610
No, THAT!

191
00:12:22,950 --> 00:12:25,240
I don't think any amount of wishful
thinking will make that happen.

192
00:12:25,320 --> 00:12:26,660
Moron!

193
00:12:30,200 --> 00:12:34,210
Reject common sense to make
the impossible possible!

194
00:12:34,290 --> 00:12:36,750
We made it up here
to the surface, didn't we?

195
00:12:36,880 --> 00:12:39,420
It can't be impossible
to go to the moon!

196
00:12:43,010 --> 00:12:46,590
When you say it, I feel
like we really could.

197
00:12:49,260 --> 00:12:51,680
Fate is a funny thing,
ain't it?

198
00:12:52,220 --> 00:12:55,350
If you hadn't dug up
Lagann that day...

199
00:12:55,440 --> 00:12:57,650
...and that Gunmen hadn't
come through the ceiling,

200
00:12:57,730 --> 00:12:59,860
...who knows what we'd
be doing right now?

201
00:13:05,490 --> 00:13:09,660
Look up!
That's the surface!

202
00:13:09,990 --> 00:13:12,240
What did I tell you?
There's a surface, all right!

203
00:13:12,330 --> 00:13:16,000
This big mug fell from the surface!
It fell from above!

204
00:13:16,120 --> 00:13:18,080
Ain't that right, Mr. Chief?

205
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:24,960
Bro, this way!

206
00:13:25,090 --> 00:13:26,170
Bro?

207
00:13:28,550 --> 00:13:30,930
You've got guts,
plowing into my village...

208
00:13:31,220 --> 00:13:34,430
...with this big ugly mug
of yours, you know that?

209
00:13:35,060 --> 00:13:36,600
R-Run!

210
00:13:37,270 --> 00:13:39,770
The bad reputation of Team Gurren
echoes far and wide in Giha Village!

211
00:13:40,110 --> 00:13:42,480
When they talk about
its badass leader,

212
00:13:42,570 --> 00:13:45,400
...that man of indomitable spirit,
that paragon of masculinity,

213
00:13:46,070 --> 00:13:48,570
...they're talking about ME,
the mighty Kamina!

214
00:13:53,370 --> 00:13:55,290
All right, you two!
Get back!

215
00:13:56,330 --> 00:13:57,790
Something else from the surface?

216
00:13:57,870 --> 00:13:59,250
Yeah, it's a girl this time.

217
00:13:59,420 --> 00:14:04,210
Damn, you got a fine body!
Surface chicks are a breed apart!

218
00:14:04,630 --> 00:14:07,970
Do I need to tell you again to run?
Do you have a death wish?

219
00:14:16,230 --> 00:14:18,640
This is it? The face you
wanted to show me?

220
00:14:18,770 --> 00:14:19,440
Yep.

221
00:14:19,560 --> 00:14:22,270
This is TWO awesome things
you've dug up now, kid.

222
00:14:22,360 --> 00:14:25,530
Bro, let's use this to take out
that thing up there! That big face!

223
00:14:25,940 --> 00:14:27,940
Let's waste it.

224
00:14:39,080 --> 00:14:40,420
You did it, Simon!

225
00:14:40,580 --> 00:14:42,500
Yeah, Bro!

226
00:14:42,630 --> 00:14:43,960
Here we go!

227
00:14:46,340 --> 00:14:48,170
You weren't expecting THIS,
were ya, you Gunmen S.O.B.?

228
00:14:48,260 --> 00:14:52,390
Even if heaven itself tolerates your
brutality, the mighty Lagann doesn't!

229
00:14:58,480 --> 00:15:00,850
- A drill?
- It just sorta popped out.

230
00:15:00,900 --> 00:15:03,350
That's your kind of weapon!
It's a perfect match!

231
00:15:04,230 --> 00:15:07,690
All right, then! Smash us
into that big mug!

232
00:15:07,860 --> 00:15:10,280
Give it a taste of the power
of Team Gurren's mighty drill!

233
00:15:10,360 --> 00:15:11,200
Yeah!

234
00:15:20,080 --> 00:15:23,630
Farewell, Giha Village!
We're off to the surface!

235
00:15:24,040 --> 00:15:25,920
Off to the surface
I saw as a kid!

236
00:15:41,810 --> 00:15:45,440
I remember that sight as if
it were only yesterday.

237
00:15:46,440 --> 00:15:47,440
Yeah...

238
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:51,820
But we found out that the surface
belonged to the Gunmen.

239
00:15:52,910 --> 00:15:56,950
All the humans on the surface were
to be exterminated by the Gunmen.

240
00:15:57,240 --> 00:16:00,040
That was the law of the land
up on the surface.

241
00:16:00,120 --> 00:16:01,540
Even your dad was killed...

242
00:16:01,910 --> 00:16:05,580
It is what it is.
That's the kind of harsh world it is.

243
00:16:06,130 --> 00:16:08,800
But we'll survive it.

244
00:16:08,880 --> 00:16:11,170
It was that fighting spirit
that won us Gurren.

245
00:16:22,390 --> 00:16:24,190
Huh? This character
was in the show?

246
00:16:25,060 --> 00:16:26,560
You forgot him already?!

247
00:16:26,690 --> 00:16:28,190
A white sands gator-bunny?

248
00:16:28,480 --> 00:16:30,110
No, that's this.

249
00:16:30,570 --> 00:16:32,400
Oh! A slime grape hippo!

250
00:16:33,030 --> 00:16:34,650
That's this.

251
00:16:35,110 --> 00:16:37,370
I've got it!
It's a flying raccoon!

252
00:16:37,410 --> 00:16:38,700
Wrong!

253
00:16:39,200 --> 00:16:43,750
Human Race Eradication Forces,
Far East Theater Commander Viral.

254
00:16:44,830 --> 00:16:48,580
How could you forget him?
He was one seriously tough opponent!

255
00:16:48,750 --> 00:16:53,880
Dumbass! Working together,
a bozo like him is no match for us!

256
00:17:02,600 --> 00:17:06,730
And that's the series of adventures
that brought us here...

257
00:17:06,810 --> 00:17:10,150
We even met other humans who
were fighting the Gunmen.

258
00:17:17,320 --> 00:17:21,450
Say, Bro... Isn't it kinda quiet
next door?

259
00:17:25,660 --> 00:17:27,620
This is fishy...

260
00:17:28,500 --> 00:17:29,960
Very fishy...

261
00:17:31,840 --> 00:17:34,300
Too suspicious by half...

262
00:17:39,090 --> 00:17:41,390
I don't hear any signs
of life over there...

263
00:17:41,470 --> 00:17:43,470
Something might have happened!

264
00:17:44,930 --> 00:17:47,940
Y-Yoko!
You okay in there?!

265
00:17:49,350 --> 00:17:51,650
Nobody's here...

266
00:17:51,900 --> 00:17:54,980
Where did the girls go?!

267
00:18:11,750 --> 00:18:16,380
T-This bathhouse was a Gunmen?!

268
00:18:17,880 --> 00:18:21,510
Now, I believe it's time
to begin our human hunt!

269
00:18:21,760 --> 00:18:25,390
Hey, you're a Beastman! Coming out
at night is against the rules!

270
00:18:27,060 --> 00:18:29,770
Sorry, but my kind is nocturnal!

271
00:18:31,270 --> 00:18:34,820
This way! I set them up so they
could be used at a moment's notice!

272
00:18:35,480 --> 00:18:36,320
Thank you!

273
00:18:36,440 --> 00:18:38,400
Let's combine, Simon!

274
00:18:38,860 --> 00:18:40,360
Bro, look!

275
00:18:41,740 --> 00:18:43,120
You Gurren-nappers!

276
00:18:43,530 --> 00:18:45,490
That was horrible...

277
00:18:45,580 --> 00:18:48,040
The whole bathhouse started
moving all of a sudden.

278
00:18:48,540 --> 00:18:51,210
Where in the world did Kamina
and the others get to?

279
00:18:55,590 --> 00:18:56,960
Why, this is Gurren!

280
00:18:59,550 --> 00:19:03,640
She's holding the girls hostage!
What're we gonna do, Bro?

281
00:19:03,760 --> 00:19:05,640
- Save us, Kamina!
- Save us, Kamina!

282
00:19:06,770 --> 00:19:09,480
Right! Jump up and latch
onto its face, Simon!

283
00:19:11,310 --> 00:19:14,810
How dare you take delicious food
and a hot bath, the two greatest...

284
00:19:14,900 --> 00:19:17,530
...pleasures in life for girls,
and use them as a trap!

285
00:19:17,690 --> 00:19:19,360
You sleazy Beastmen!

286
00:19:19,440 --> 00:19:22,820
Even if heaven itself forgives
your brutality, Yoko won't!

287
00:19:34,080 --> 00:19:36,380
I am so dead, Bro!

288
00:19:36,460 --> 00:19:37,550
Suck it up!

289
00:19:37,590 --> 00:19:39,340
Crap!

290
00:19:44,340 --> 00:19:45,550
Welcome, welcome!

291
00:19:45,760 --> 00:19:46,970
Welcome!

292
00:19:48,890 --> 00:19:50,310
Welcome!

293
00:19:52,350 --> 00:19:53,810
Welcome, welcome!

294
00:19:54,400 --> 00:19:56,940
Get outta my way, toadies!

295
00:20:10,620 --> 00:20:12,120
You're history!

296
00:20:20,380 --> 00:20:21,380
What happened?!

297
00:20:21,470 --> 00:20:24,840
Engine room here! Those women
that escaped are--

298
00:20:25,970 --> 00:20:27,260
Damn them!

299
00:20:30,850 --> 00:20:33,350
- Right! Ready to go?
- I think not!

300
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:36,690
You have had your fun
for long enough, Kamina.

301
00:20:37,650 --> 00:20:39,480
The next time you move,
you die!

302
00:20:39,650 --> 00:20:41,400
QUIT SCREWING WITH ME!

303
00:20:41,570 --> 00:20:43,820
Your threats won't work
on the mighty Kamina!

304
00:20:43,950 --> 00:20:45,450
My wrath is at
the boiling point!

305
00:20:45,570 --> 00:20:49,280
Sit in the tub 'til you're
all red as lobsters!

306
00:20:49,620 --> 00:20:51,830
SIMON!

307
00:20:53,620 --> 00:20:54,660
Bro!

308
00:20:54,750 --> 00:20:56,210
Pile in, everybody!

309
00:20:56,290 --> 00:20:58,670
- We can't all fit!
- I'm falling out!

310
00:20:58,750 --> 00:21:00,750
Close the canopy,
and we'll fit!

311
00:21:01,710 --> 00:21:03,010
It's so cramped...

312
00:21:03,130 --> 00:21:05,220
Won't this make it
too heavy to move?

313
00:21:05,340 --> 00:21:06,800
No, it'll work!

314
00:21:11,930 --> 00:21:13,930
Look! It's Gurren!

315
00:21:14,480 --> 00:21:17,560
Just like you said, Kamina, I was able
to power it with fighting spirit.

316
00:21:17,810 --> 00:21:19,690
Way to go, Forehead Boy!

317
00:21:19,820 --> 00:21:22,480
Okay, let's combine!

318
00:21:25,030 --> 00:21:26,150
Um, shall I get out?

319
00:21:26,240 --> 00:21:27,780
There's no time!

320
00:21:30,830 --> 00:21:33,160
- Man's Wrath...
- What?!

321
00:21:33,450 --> 00:21:36,750
...Explosive Slash!

322
00:21:40,750 --> 00:21:44,210
We did it! We did it!
We did it!

323
00:21:46,170 --> 00:21:48,130
Good mornin', sunshine...

324
00:22:07,030 --> 00:22:09,160
W-What was that?!

325
00:22:24,550 --> 00:22:28,130
It's been a long time,
naked ape!

326
00:22:28,880 --> 00:22:30,930
Um, who's this guy again?

327
00:22:31,010 --> 00:22:35,010
To Be Continued...

328
00:22:42,250 --> 00:22:48,480
<font color=#FFFF00>Hikari wo motomete kage ha tawainai jooku wo shaberu
</font>'Cuz they seek light, the shadows chatter out grade-school jokes

329
00:22:48,480 --> 00:22:54,460
<font color=#FFFF00>Kikitai no ha sonna koto ja nai
</font>I don't want to listen to that crap

330
00:23:00,930 --> 00:23:06,990
<font color=#FFFF00>Taiyou motomete kage ha tamashii no nuketa koe kara
</font>'Cuz they seek the sun, the shadows suddenly change from

331
00:23:06,990 --> 00:23:12,870
<font color=#FFFF00>Kyuu ni surudoi kuchou ni kawaru
</font>The soul's missing voice to a sharp tone of voice

332
00:23:13,030 --> 00:23:19,580
<font color=#FFFF00>Sono oto ga machi no naka ni kodama-shite hibikinagara
</font>While that sound echoed and bounced in the middle of town,

333
00:23:19,580 --> 00:23:25,620
<font color=#FFFF00>Kemono no you na koe de sakebitsudzuketa
</font>I kept on screaming in a beastly voice

334
00:23:25,660 --> 00:23:28,890
<font color=#FFFF00>Kidou wo kaeta tsumori ha nai
</font>No way I'm going to change my course

335
00:23:28,890 --> 00:23:32,090
<font color=#FFFF00>Zankyou ha giratsuiteru ga
</font>The reverb's dazzling, but

336
00:23:32,090 --> 00:23:35,130
<font color=#FFFF00>Kussetsu-shite hanarete iku
</font>It refracts and comes apart

337
00:23:35,130 --> 00:23:39,260
<font color=#FFFF00>Koko no sekai ha itsumo kou da
</font>The world right here is always like this

338
00:23:46,180 --> 00:23:52,700
<font color=#FFFF00>Soto no sekai ni ha hikari ha aru no ka
</font>Is there light in the world outside?

339
00:24:05,520 --> 00:24:08,520
<b>Next Time</b>

340
00:24:06,570 --> 00:24:08,520
There are times when a man's gotta do
what a man's gotta do.

341
00:24:08,860 --> 00:24:10,940
Sometime, somewhere,
maybe here, maybe there,

342
00:24:11,030 --> 00:24:12,780
...you might come across
a golden opportunity.

343
00:24:12,860 --> 00:24:14,570
Whether you live or die
is up to your ability!

344
00:24:14,870 --> 00:24:19,540
Next time on Gurren Lagann,
"You're Gonna Do It!"

345
00:24:14,840 --> 00:24:20,540
<b>You're Gonna Do It!</b>
