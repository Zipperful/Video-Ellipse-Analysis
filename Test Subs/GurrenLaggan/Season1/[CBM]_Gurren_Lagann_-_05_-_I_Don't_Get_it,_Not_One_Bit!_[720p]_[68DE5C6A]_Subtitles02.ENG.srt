1
00:00:10,670 --> 00:00:15,510
Gurren Lagann

2
00:00:15,580 --> 00:00:18,110
<font color=#FFFF00>Kimi ha kikoeru?
</font>Can you hear it?

3
00:00:18,250 --> 00:00:26,250
<font color=#FFFF00>Boku no kono koe ga yami ni munashiku suikomareta
</font>This voice of mine was sucked emptily into darkness

4
00:00:26,600 --> 00:00:31,700
<font color=#FFFF00>Moshimo sekai ga imi wo motsu no nara
</font>If the world has meaning to it,

5
00:00:32,030 --> 00:00:36,570
<font color=#FFFF00>Konna kimochi mo muda de ha nai
</font>Then these kinds of feelings aren't futile

6
00:00:36,910 --> 00:00:42,610
<font color=#FFFF00>Akogare ni oshitsubusarete akirametetanda
</font>I was crushed by my longing and had given up

7
00:00:42,910 --> 00:00:47,870
<font color=#FFFF00>Hateshinai sora no iro mo shiranaide
</font>Without even knowing the color of the endless sky

8
00:00:48,280 --> 00:00:53,190
<font color=#FFFF00>Hashiridashita omoi ga ima demo
</font>I began to run, because my feelings, even now,

9
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:58,960
<font color=#FFFF00>Kono mune wo tashika ni tataiteru kara
</font>Are definitely beating against my heart

10
00:00:59,230 --> 00:01:04,030
<font color=#FFFF00>Kyou no boku ga sono saki ni tsudzuku
</font>The me of today will continue towards our destination

11
00:01:04,500 --> 00:01:10,060
<font color=#FFFF00>Bokura nari no asu wo kizuite yuku
</font>We'll amass our own tomorrows

12
00:01:10,410 --> 00:01:18,900
<font color=#FFFF00>Kotae ha sou itsumo koko ni aru
</font>The answer, yes, is always right here

13
00:01:31,500 --> 00:01:37,220
This is the tale of a man who has yet
to realize what his destiny is.

14
00:01:37,510 --> 00:01:41,890
Simon's Lagann and Kamina's Gurren
perfect their combination technique,

15
00:01:42,390 --> 00:01:44,770
...and the result is named
Gurren Lagann.

16
00:01:44,850 --> 00:01:49,770
Their journey in search of the enemy's
headquarters continues. However...

17
00:01:54,030 --> 00:01:56,400
You know, we haven't seen
any Gunmen lately.

18
00:01:56,490 --> 00:01:59,530
You have a point. I don't want
my skills to get rusty.

19
00:01:59,780 --> 00:02:02,240
What're you doing
in here, anyway?

20
00:02:02,910 --> 00:02:04,830
We built you guys a place
out of wreckage, didn't we?

21
00:02:04,950 --> 00:02:07,910
This is the best place to be
while we're underway.

22
00:02:08,330 --> 00:02:10,920
That thing bounces around so much,
it's murder on my butt.

23
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,460
You sure it's not 'cause
your ass is too big?

24
00:02:14,670 --> 00:02:15,960
What did you say?!

25
00:02:16,090 --> 00:02:17,670
Ah, this is so comfy!

26
00:02:17,800 --> 00:02:20,130
Geez, you're heavy!

27
00:02:20,220 --> 00:02:23,800
You sure your brains haven't settled
into your ass, you dumb broad?

28
00:02:24,260 --> 00:02:25,850
Oh, you don't say?

29
00:02:25,970 --> 00:02:29,100
Sounds to me like you want a taste
of one of my meatball bullets.

30
00:02:29,350 --> 00:02:30,600
No, not those!

31
00:02:34,190 --> 00:02:37,570
The surface around here seems to have
been made comparatively recently.

32
00:02:38,070 --> 00:02:39,320
How recent is "recently"?

33
00:02:39,530 --> 00:02:43,530
Oh, about four or five
hundred years, I'd say.

34
00:02:43,830 --> 00:02:46,540
Ow! Don't shoot, you crazy bitch!
You'll kill me!

35
00:02:46,660 --> 00:02:48,750
These little things won't
kill you, you big baby!

36
00:02:53,420 --> 00:02:56,210
They never get tired
of fighting, do they?

37
00:03:03,510 --> 00:03:05,680
Kamina and Yoko
fell through.

38
00:03:12,190 --> 00:03:15,730
What an enormous cavern!
I've never seen anything like it!

39
00:03:16,110 --> 00:03:19,070
How far down
does this thing go?!

40
00:03:23,870 --> 00:03:29,620
Episode 5:
I Don't Get it, Not One Bit!

41
00:03:59,530 --> 00:04:01,940
Good thing I came
around first...

42
00:04:04,280 --> 00:04:06,070
People have come from
the Face God!

43
00:04:06,160 --> 00:04:08,030
Messengers from the
Celestial Lands!

44
00:04:08,330 --> 00:04:10,200
Face God?

45
00:04:12,370 --> 00:04:13,580
That's a--

46
00:04:14,580 --> 00:04:16,460
That's a Gunmen!

47
00:04:18,460 --> 00:04:20,210
- What a wreck...
- Please don't touch that!

48
00:04:24,130 --> 00:04:27,680
That is our village's
guardian deity.

49
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:34,810
Yo, Forehead Boy! Don't you have
more to throw on the fire?

50
00:04:34,940 --> 00:04:38,690
My name is Rossiu.
This is all we have here.

51
00:04:39,270 --> 00:04:40,900
This place is a barrel
of laughs, ain't it?

52
00:04:40,980 --> 00:04:43,070
Hey! Don't be rude!

53
00:04:43,150 --> 00:04:46,860
Hey! Did you guys really come from
the Celestial Lands?

54
00:04:47,200 --> 00:04:49,200
Are you messengers
of the Face God?

55
00:04:49,870 --> 00:04:51,490
What's the deal with these kids?

56
00:04:51,580 --> 00:04:53,540
Stop bothering our guests,
Gimmy, Darry.

57
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,330
Go somewhere else.

58
00:04:55,420 --> 00:04:57,040
Okay...

59
00:04:57,380 --> 00:05:02,340
I'm terribly sorry. Those children have
no parents, so everyone spoils them.

60
00:05:02,460 --> 00:05:04,210
Who cares about that?

61
00:05:04,550 --> 00:05:06,760
More importantly, what's that
Gunmen doing there?

62
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:09,470
Gunmen? You mean
the Face God?

63
00:05:09,510 --> 00:05:10,970
Wait, you don't know
what that is?

64
00:05:11,100 --> 00:05:13,390
Hah, you weren't any different
not too long ago.

65
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:17,230
What the hell?! What did I do to
deserve all this grief from you?

66
00:05:17,690 --> 00:05:19,270
Oh, shut up!

67
00:05:20,190 --> 00:05:21,940
Um, Yoko?

68
00:05:22,110 --> 00:05:23,070
Yes?

69
00:05:23,780 --> 00:05:27,530
I'm sorry, but would you
mind putting this on?

70
00:05:28,530 --> 00:05:29,610
Why?

71
00:05:29,700 --> 00:05:33,290
Well, um... Perhaps you
could cover up?

72
00:05:33,490 --> 00:05:36,200
Your manner of dress is...
Well, it is indecent!

73
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:45,840
I'm not crazy about outfits like this
that restrict my movements.

74
00:05:46,840 --> 00:05:48,180
What now?

75
00:05:48,760 --> 00:05:53,470
Boy, take away the bare midriff,
and you got nothing left, do ya?

76
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:05,070
Scum! Thug!
Stinking louse!

77
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:08,450
You are one hopeless pervert
of a man, you know that?

78
00:06:08,780 --> 00:06:11,200
Don't pick up his habits,
okay, Simon?

79
00:06:11,320 --> 00:06:13,030
Please stop this
violent behavior!

80
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:17,580
I would expect Celestians to refrain from
such lewd conduct in front of our villagers.

81
00:06:18,620 --> 00:06:21,790
Celestians?
These people are Celestians?

82
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:26,250
Yes, they travel in the
company of Face Gods.

83
00:06:26,550 --> 00:06:28,130
Please show them
all due respect.

84
00:06:28,260 --> 00:06:29,970
Rossiu!

85
00:06:30,090 --> 00:06:31,220
Yes, what is it?

86
00:06:31,260 --> 00:06:35,350
T-There's a problem!
Ucom's wife just gave birth!

87
00:06:35,560 --> 00:06:37,140
But that is good news!

88
00:06:37,770 --> 00:06:41,350
I was about to suggest to our guests
that we visit the High Priest.

89
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:45,770
The thing is, one child is a girl,
and the second is a boy.

90
00:06:45,900 --> 00:06:47,320
As is the third!

91
00:06:47,400 --> 00:06:49,190
What?!

92
00:06:50,070 --> 00:06:52,990
Huh? Why are they
freaking out?

93
00:06:53,240 --> 00:06:56,410
Triplets?
To Ucom and his wife?

94
00:06:56,490 --> 00:06:57,660
Yes.

95
00:06:57,790 --> 00:07:01,000
So, that brings the village's
population to 52.

96
00:07:01,330 --> 00:07:04,080
We must choose two, then.

97
00:07:04,250 --> 00:07:06,960
Must we go through
with this, Father Magin?

98
00:07:09,380 --> 00:07:13,930
Rossiu, do you not understand?
This rite bestows a great blessing.

99
00:07:14,350 --> 00:07:18,850
We will celebrate the chosen,
just as we did with your mother.

100
00:07:21,100 --> 00:07:25,730
Man, this place is depressing.
Old Giha Village was nothing like this.

101
00:07:27,570 --> 00:07:28,980
Is it time to eat yet?

102
00:07:29,110 --> 00:07:30,400
Isn't that what this is?

103
00:07:30,490 --> 00:07:32,070
This ain't enough!

104
00:07:32,200 --> 00:07:35,740
I need me some meat...
I wanna have meat!

105
00:07:37,160 --> 00:07:39,910
I suspect that this is
a grand welcome for us.

106
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:42,790
They have no electricity.
No herds of livestock.

107
00:07:42,870 --> 00:07:46,380
All they have here is a tiny pond
and a broken Gunmen.

108
00:07:46,880 --> 00:07:49,340
Which means that even a meal
like this is precious.

109
00:07:49,420 --> 00:07:52,840
My apologies. Was the meal
not to your liking?

110
00:07:56,890 --> 00:08:02,430
If it is not too much trouble, might I impose
on you to tell me of the Celestial Lands?

111
00:08:02,690 --> 00:08:04,310
Really, Forehead Boy?

112
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:07,190
Does that mean you want more
than the life of a celler dweller?

113
00:08:07,320 --> 00:08:11,990
Then let me get this out of the way!
Gunmen are no gods!

114
00:08:12,150 --> 00:08:15,280
But that has been our belief
since long before I was born.

115
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:17,370
Your people have always
lived like this?

116
00:08:17,450 --> 00:08:21,080
No, they say that our lot has improved
considerably since the High Priest...

117
00:08:21,160 --> 00:08:23,370
...took over the administration
of the village.

118
00:08:23,580 --> 00:08:26,000
This High Priest guy,
who is he?

119
00:08:26,580 --> 00:08:32,130
Celestians, please do not test
this boy's piety any further.

120
00:08:32,380 --> 00:08:36,890
Your words are too much
for our people to accept.

121
00:08:37,390 --> 00:08:38,890
You're the High Priest?

122
00:08:39,010 --> 00:08:41,720
I apologize for neglecting
to introduce myself.

123
00:08:41,810 --> 00:08:45,230
I am called Magin,
and I govern this village.

124
00:08:45,350 --> 00:08:49,230
Is that a fact? You're the head honcho
of this little dump, huh?

125
00:08:51,280 --> 00:08:55,450
Rossiu, we have an important
ceremony tomorrow. Go to bed.

126
00:08:55,570 --> 00:08:56,360
Yes, Father.

127
00:08:56,450 --> 00:08:59,490
You and your friends should
turn in for the night, as well.

128
00:08:59,700 --> 00:09:01,280
If you will excuse me...

129
00:09:01,950 --> 00:09:03,120
Bro?!

130
00:09:03,250 --> 00:09:05,620
Are you some kind of moron?!

131
00:09:05,830 --> 00:09:07,250
I don't like that guy.

132
00:09:07,380 --> 00:09:11,000
Not his ugly mug, and definitely not
that holier-than-thou attitude.

133
00:09:12,510 --> 00:09:16,010
<font color=#FFC9B9>Gurren Lagann</font>

134
00:09:17,510 --> 00:09:21,010
<font color=#FFC9B9>Gurren Lagann</font>

135
00:10:05,470 --> 00:10:07,730
Wow, the thing still works!

136
00:10:08,100 --> 00:10:09,140
Good morning.

137
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:14,480
Take it for a spin, Forehead Boy.
The key to making it work is spirit!

138
00:10:15,650 --> 00:10:17,690
I had no intention of doing so...

139
00:10:18,280 --> 00:10:22,950
Put everything else out of your head!
Just do what feels natural!

140
00:10:23,530 --> 00:10:25,200
It's a great feeling.

141
00:10:26,330 --> 00:10:27,750
Rossiu!

142
00:10:28,210 --> 00:10:29,870
F-Father Magin!

143
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,500
There he is again.

144
00:10:31,630 --> 00:10:33,840
What are you doing, Rossiu?

145
00:10:33,960 --> 00:10:36,880
Who told you that you may
touch the Face God?

146
00:10:37,380 --> 00:10:39,090
I-I apologize.

147
00:10:39,380 --> 00:10:41,380
Hang on a minute, old-timer!

148
00:10:41,840 --> 00:10:43,140
It finally came to me.

149
00:10:43,220 --> 00:10:44,600
Bro...

150
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:48,020
I was trying to figure out why your
ugly mug pisses me off so much,

151
00:10:48,100 --> 00:10:50,440
...and I realized that you look like
the chief of our old village.

152
00:10:50,520 --> 00:10:51,730
Right, Simon?

153
00:10:52,150 --> 00:10:53,690
Hm, maybe he does...

154
00:10:53,770 --> 00:10:54,940
You and your friends...

155
00:10:55,020 --> 00:10:56,320
Oh, you wanna fight?

156
00:10:56,860 --> 00:11:00,320
...ought to leave this village if you
have no further business here.

157
00:11:00,660 --> 00:11:01,700
Say what?!

158
00:11:01,780 --> 00:11:03,320
Huh?

159
00:11:12,040 --> 00:11:15,500
Father Magin, surely it does
not need to be held now.

160
00:11:15,800 --> 00:11:20,170
All three of these children
might not survive.

161
00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:23,340
Please do not misunderstand, Ucom.

162
00:11:23,430 --> 00:11:27,390
Those chosen during this rite
receive the gods' blessing.

163
00:11:27,470 --> 00:11:29,720
Now, please draw.

164
00:11:30,560 --> 00:11:34,850
T-Then I'll draw for my wife
and children, too.

165
00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:42,240
Next, please.

166
00:11:42,570 --> 00:11:43,610
Yes, Father.

167
00:11:55,250 --> 00:11:57,920
Is there anyone who
has not drawn a lot yet?

168
00:11:58,170 --> 00:11:59,880
Gimmy hasn't gone yet!

169
00:12:00,010 --> 00:12:01,460
Neither has Darry!

170
00:12:01,590 --> 00:12:03,510
Oh, my apologies.

171
00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:05,890
You two are the last, then.

172
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:11,850
Now, open your hands.

173
00:12:11,930 --> 00:12:15,440
If your lot has a mark, you have
been chosen by the gods.

174
00:12:22,280 --> 00:12:24,990
She won!
Darry won!

175
00:12:25,070 --> 00:12:26,660
So did you, Gimmy!

176
00:12:26,740 --> 00:12:28,990
Hey, you're right!
We both won!

177
00:12:29,410 --> 00:12:31,330
- Yay, we won!
- We won!

178
00:12:31,950 --> 00:12:33,790
We won, we won!

179
00:12:39,300 --> 00:12:41,300
What are you saying?

180
00:12:41,960 --> 00:12:45,300
What do you mean,
take these kids with us?

181
00:12:45,380 --> 00:12:48,640
Whenever the village's
population exceeds 50,

182
00:12:48,760 --> 00:12:53,640
...some are chosen to be the gods' children
and are sent up to the Celestial Lands.

183
00:12:53,770 --> 00:12:56,520
Celestial Lands?
You mean the surface?!

184
00:12:56,560 --> 00:12:58,730
But that's crazy!
You can't send these kids there!

185
00:12:59,770 --> 00:13:01,520
That is your answer, then?

186
00:13:01,940 --> 00:13:04,530
You handle rejection better
than I expected, old-timer.

187
00:13:04,650 --> 00:13:08,160
I don't think that's
what he means, Bro.

188
00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:10,450
You leave us with
no choice, then.

189
00:13:10,530 --> 00:13:14,330
We will conduct our ceremony
in the usual manner.

190
00:13:14,460 --> 00:13:17,460
Wait just a damn minute! What's one
or two more kids running around?

191
00:13:17,540 --> 00:13:19,210
You don't have to
throw them out!

192
00:13:19,710 --> 00:13:23,340
To be sent up to the Celestial Lands
means to be released...

193
00:13:23,420 --> 00:13:27,550
...from all the sorrows of this life
and to live together with the gods.

194
00:13:28,050 --> 00:13:29,760
It is the ultimate happiness.

195
00:13:29,850 --> 00:13:33,520
Why does it have to be this way?
I don't get it, not one bit!

196
00:13:34,020 --> 00:13:37,850
Hasn't anybody ever considered going up
to see what it's really like up there?

197
00:13:38,350 --> 00:13:40,190
C'mon, take us there!

198
00:13:40,270 --> 00:13:42,480
What're the
Celestial Lands like?

199
00:13:42,610 --> 00:13:46,490
It ain't exactly paradise up there!
We can't drag two kids around with us!

200
00:13:46,610 --> 00:13:47,490
Why not?!

201
00:13:47,570 --> 00:13:49,200
- You're mean!
- Meanie!

202
00:13:49,280 --> 00:13:53,990
Would you please stop berating our ways
every chance you get?

203
00:13:54,160 --> 00:13:55,540
Excuse me?!

204
00:13:55,620 --> 00:13:58,670
Look, old-timer, don't try
to play the victim here!

205
00:13:59,120 --> 00:14:00,250
How dare you!

206
00:14:00,330 --> 00:14:02,170
Mind your tone when speaking
to the High Priest!

207
00:14:02,250 --> 00:14:05,710
Let it go, Bro. It's their law
here in this village.

208
00:14:05,800 --> 00:14:08,340
It's not like they're doing it
because they want to.

209
00:14:08,470 --> 00:14:10,890
If you don't WANT to do it, all they
have to do is STOP doing it!

210
00:14:11,350 --> 00:14:13,300
Who the hell do you
think I am?

211
00:14:13,390 --> 00:14:17,270
I'm Kamina, who would rather die than
do something he doesn't wanna do!

212
00:14:17,690 --> 00:14:22,650
Listen up, people! This guy's a fraud
who's been feeding you a load of crap!

213
00:14:22,770 --> 00:14:23,570
Don't fall for it!

214
00:14:23,690 --> 00:14:29,280
Please stop this! What do you
know of life in our village?

215
00:14:29,570 --> 00:14:33,530
Ah, you're finally starting
to speak my language.

216
00:14:33,620 --> 00:14:36,540
Stop this, Rossiu!
Don't resort to violence!

217
00:14:36,620 --> 00:14:41,960
I don't understand! How can these people
be messengers of the gods?

218
00:14:42,380 --> 00:14:45,250
Endure this trial.
The gods are testing us.

219
00:14:45,340 --> 00:14:46,710
C'mon, kiddo!

220
00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:48,420
Stop it this instant, Rossiu!

221
00:14:48,880 --> 00:14:51,050
The mighty Kamina is ready
to take you on!

222
00:14:51,180 --> 00:14:54,100
Yo, Forehead Boy!
What are you, man or mouse?

223
00:14:54,220 --> 00:14:55,600
Man or mouse?!

224
00:14:57,390 --> 00:14:58,930
What the hell?!

225
00:15:08,030 --> 00:15:09,900
It's another Face God!

226
00:15:14,120 --> 00:15:16,450
Gurren Lagann, I found you!

227
00:15:20,920 --> 00:15:22,710
Get moving, Kamina!
Simon!

228
00:15:24,500 --> 00:15:26,130
Thanks, Yoko!

229
00:15:27,090 --> 00:15:29,630
What do you think you're
doing to the Face God?

230
00:15:29,720 --> 00:15:31,300
The gods will smite you!

231
00:15:32,510 --> 00:15:34,430
This is getting old...

232
00:15:39,310 --> 00:15:39,930
Bro!

233
00:15:40,430 --> 00:15:41,680
Ready!

234
00:15:41,940 --> 00:15:44,020
Let's do this with style!

235
00:16:22,640 --> 00:16:28,610
Brotherly Combining!
Gurren Lagann!

236
00:16:40,290 --> 00:16:42,790
One Face God is fighting
another Face God!

237
00:16:42,910 --> 00:16:44,210
How can this be?!

238
00:16:44,540 --> 00:16:47,000
You guys down there!
What're you standing around for?!

239
00:16:47,080 --> 00:16:48,210
You're in the way!

240
00:16:48,340 --> 00:16:50,670
Get clear! Hurry!

241
00:17:03,640 --> 00:17:07,100
These things are no gods!
They're the enemy!

242
00:17:07,650 --> 00:17:09,650
They're the enemy
we fight against!

243
00:17:09,770 --> 00:17:11,150
Bro, it's no use!

244
00:17:11,230 --> 00:17:14,990
These people have believed that Gunmen
are gods their whole lives!

245
00:17:16,450 --> 00:17:21,830
In that case, we're gonna kick this
thing's ass right in front of them!

246
00:17:22,120 --> 00:17:24,910
That'll make 'em see sense
whether they want to or not!

247
00:17:26,290 --> 00:17:27,670
Bro, you're overdoing it!

248
00:17:27,750 --> 00:17:29,080
Butt out!

249
00:17:33,670 --> 00:17:34,880
W-What the--?

250
00:17:35,170 --> 00:17:36,470
The idol!

251
00:17:38,890 --> 00:17:44,520
What are you doing?
Don't interfere, you piece ofjunk!

252
00:17:56,780 --> 00:17:58,200
What the hell?

253
00:18:24,310 --> 00:18:27,680
What is going on here,
Father Magin?

254
00:18:34,940 --> 00:18:35,940
Father Magin!

255
00:18:54,550 --> 00:18:58,050
I don't like you.
I don't like you at all, old-timer.

256
00:18:58,340 --> 00:19:00,630
If you had that much spirit
all along, why didn't you--

257
00:19:01,260 --> 00:19:03,800
I mimicked what I saw
you do, that's all.

258
00:19:03,890 --> 00:19:06,510
I myself do not understand
what I was doing.

259
00:19:07,060 --> 00:19:09,520
I beg you, it is time
for you to leave.

260
00:19:09,600 --> 00:19:12,310
Don't disturb our village any more
than you already have.

261
00:19:12,350 --> 00:19:13,270
Say what?!

262
00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:14,610
Let it go, Bro!

263
00:19:14,690 --> 00:19:20,190
What he says is right. We don't
belong here in this village.

264
00:19:22,570 --> 00:19:28,370
I don't get it. I don't get it,
not one damn bit.

265
00:19:39,340 --> 00:19:41,630
Perhaps we should
tell everyone the truth.

266
00:19:42,680 --> 00:19:45,140
What is the truth, Rossiu?

267
00:19:45,220 --> 00:19:50,180
If the truth would destroy this village,
do they need to know it?

268
00:19:51,140 --> 00:19:55,690
This village does not have the resources
to sustain a large population.

269
00:19:55,770 --> 00:20:00,570
The first thing I did when I became
leader of the village...

270
00:20:00,860 --> 00:20:04,070
...was to set a limit of 50 on
the people who may live here.

271
00:20:04,490 --> 00:20:07,030
We must not exceed that number,
not even by one.

272
00:20:07,120 --> 00:20:10,950
If we succumb to sentimentality
or emotion, the village is lost.

273
00:20:11,580 --> 00:20:14,830
For me, that is the
one and only truth.

274
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:19,170
My religion is nothing more
than a tool to that end.

275
00:20:20,630 --> 00:20:25,090
Did you also arrange it so that Gimmy
and Darry would be chosen?

276
00:20:25,180 --> 00:20:27,800
Yes, because those children
have no family.

277
00:20:27,890 --> 00:20:31,680
That way, few would
truly grieve for them.

278
00:20:31,770 --> 00:20:36,400
You're joking! If that's true,
then what about my mother?

279
00:20:39,520 --> 00:20:44,280
Any regrets I once had,
I made my peace with long ago.

280
00:20:52,910 --> 00:20:54,290
Take these, too.

281
00:20:54,410 --> 00:20:56,040
But we can't eat
this much!

282
00:20:56,580 --> 00:21:01,250
You mustn't eat it all at once.
Eat it a little at a time and make it last.

283
00:21:01,460 --> 00:21:03,170
Okay!

284
00:21:03,300 --> 00:21:05,590
Rossiu! You mean to go
through with this?

285
00:21:05,720 --> 00:21:09,180
Yes. I will go with
those children.

286
00:21:09,260 --> 00:21:13,100
Once we reclaim the surface
as a home for humanity,

287
00:21:13,230 --> 00:21:17,140
...there will no longer be any need
to be bound by such painful laws.

288
00:21:18,020 --> 00:21:24,690
Besides, won't it be easier for you if no one
else in the village knows the truth?

289
00:21:26,950 --> 00:21:28,320
I understand.

290
00:21:28,820 --> 00:21:33,830
In that case, would you like to take the
holy scriptures with you on your journey?

291
00:21:34,040 --> 00:21:36,540
Thank you but I...
I no longer believe.

292
00:21:36,670 --> 00:21:41,920
And besides, I thought you knew!
I cannot read.

293
00:21:42,300 --> 00:21:46,050
Oh, is that all? You needn't
worry about that, Rossiu.

294
00:21:46,510 --> 00:21:48,930
I can't read, either!

295
00:21:54,850 --> 00:21:59,980
This may be no more than
dead weight to you now,

296
00:22:00,060 --> 00:22:03,520
...but I would like you
to take it with you.

297
00:22:04,650 --> 00:22:07,450
Please, accept it.

298
00:22:08,910 --> 00:22:11,450
Yes, Father.

299
00:22:31,050 --> 00:22:35,180
To Be Continued...

If it's invisible,
you want to see it!

313

If you're told not to look,
you can't resist peeking!

314
00:24:10,650 --> 00:24:12,030
If it's hidden,
you want to see it!

315

That's what a man's adventure
is all about!
