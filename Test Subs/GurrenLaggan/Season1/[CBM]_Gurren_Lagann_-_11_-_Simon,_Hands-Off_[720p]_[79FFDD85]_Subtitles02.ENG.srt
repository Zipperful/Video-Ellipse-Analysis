1
00:00:10,670 --> 00:00:15,510
Gurren Lagann

2
00:00:15,580 --> 00:00:18,110
<font color=#FFFF00>Kimi ha kikoeru?
</font>Can you hear it?

3
00:00:18,250 --> 00:00:26,250
<font color=#FFFF00>Boku no kono koe ga yami ni munashiku suikomareta
</font>This voice of mine was sucked emptily into darkness

4
00:00:26,600 --> 00:00:31,700
<font color=#FFFF00>Moshimo sekai ga imi wo motsu no nara
</font>If the world has meaning to it,

5
00:00:32,030 --> 00:00:36,570
<font color=#FFFF00>Konna kimochi mo muda de ha nai
</font>Then these kinds of feelings aren't futile

6
00:00:36,910 --> 00:00:42,610
<font color=#FFFF00>Akogare ni oshitsubusarete akirametetanda
</font>I was crushed by my longing and had given up

7
00:00:42,910 --> 00:00:47,870
<font color=#FFFF00>Hateshinai sora no iro mo shiranaide
</font>Without even knowing the color of the endless sky

8
00:00:48,280 --> 00:00:53,190
<font color=#FFFF00>Hashiridashita omoi ga ima demo
</font>I began to run, because my feelings, even now,

9
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:58,960
<font color=#FFFF00>Kono mune wo tashika ni tataiteru kara
</font>Are definitely beating against my heart

10
00:00:59,230 --> 00:01:04,030
<font color=#FFFF00>Kyou no boku ga sono saki ni tsudzuku
</font>The me of today will continue towards our destination

11
00:01:04,500 --> 00:01:10,060
<font color=#FFFF00>Bokura nari no asu wo kizuite yuku
</font>We'll amass our own tomorrows

12
00:01:10,410 --> 00:01:18,900
<font color=#FFFF00>Kotae ha sou itsumo koko ni aru
</font>The answer, yes, is always right here

13
00:01:42,430 --> 00:01:45,180
So, I hear that Adiane blew it.

14
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:49,810
She went over our heads and boasted
in front of the Spiral King.

15
00:01:49,940 --> 00:01:52,730
She will not come
crawling back now.

16
00:01:52,820 --> 00:01:56,360
That said, would you do me the honor
of letting me strike next, Sire?

17
00:01:56,610 --> 00:01:57,490
Wha--?

18
00:01:58,860 --> 00:02:01,820
Guame? You, too?

19
00:02:02,240 --> 00:02:07,410
This miniature Gunmen of unknown type
that they use, it concerns me.

20
00:02:08,040 --> 00:02:12,540
And by combining with
this miniature Gunmen,

21
00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:17,300
...they also say that Gurren Lagann
exhibits power it should not possess.

22
00:02:17,590 --> 00:02:20,180
You have a good idea
what it is, I take it.

23
00:02:20,390 --> 00:02:23,180
The humans have uncovered something
they should not have.

24
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:25,680
That is all it amounts to.

25
00:02:25,770 --> 00:02:29,390
Whatever it is, it can't be
brushed off so lightly.

26
00:02:29,560 --> 00:02:31,150
Please, Sire. Indulge me.

27
00:02:31,730 --> 00:02:35,110
Guame, you dare tell me
what to do?

28
00:02:42,320 --> 00:02:44,410
I was amazed back there.

29
00:02:44,950 --> 00:02:48,410
There are few in this world who can
make the Spiral King do anything.

30
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:52,170
In that one regard, I bow
to your superiority.

31
00:02:52,500 --> 00:02:57,090
It is because that miniature Gunmen
may very well be an incredible find.

32
00:02:57,420 --> 00:03:01,010
And besides, he and I
go way back.

33
00:03:04,550 --> 00:03:07,680
You're going up against a bunch
of battle-hardened barbarians.

34
00:03:07,890 --> 00:03:10,140
There's no telling what
they'll come up with.

35
00:03:10,230 --> 00:03:12,440
Needless to say,
I have a plan.

36
00:03:13,150 --> 00:03:15,900
As I thought.
You think of everything.

37
00:03:16,150 --> 00:03:21,900
<font color=#000000>Episode 11:
Simon, Hands-Off</font>

38
00:03:28,700 --> 00:03:30,200
Everyone!

39
00:03:30,540 --> 00:03:31,160
Yeah?

40
00:03:31,250 --> 00:03:32,870
What's this?

41
00:03:33,250 --> 00:03:36,590
That? It's garbage, obviously.
It's a trash heap.

42
00:03:36,750 --> 00:03:39,670
But this is Simon's!
It's too much!

43
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:42,050
Come on, he's a lost cause.

44
00:03:42,220 --> 00:03:45,430
He's turned into a spineless kid
who's good for nothing but digging.

45
00:03:45,510 --> 00:03:47,800
He'd be better off going back
to Giha Village.

46
00:03:48,010 --> 00:03:48,810
But he's--

47
00:03:48,930 --> 00:03:52,520
There's no place here for somebody
who can't pull his own weight.

48
00:03:53,020 --> 00:03:55,650
Don't coddle Simon
too much, all right?

49
00:03:55,730 --> 00:03:57,190
Coddle him?

50
00:03:57,570 --> 00:04:01,530
He needs to snap himself out of this funk,
or it doesn't mean anything.

51
00:04:12,370 --> 00:04:15,000
Oh, this must be that "Bro" person
you keep talking about.

52
00:04:20,260 --> 00:04:22,340
I'm crazy, aren't I?

53
00:04:22,380 --> 00:04:24,590
No, you aren't crazy.

54
00:04:25,510 --> 00:04:28,470
When he's set in stone like this,
even I can see it.

55
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:32,600
I can see how much
you care for this person.

56
00:04:36,440 --> 00:04:40,110
Digging tunnels is all I'm good for.

57
00:04:40,860 --> 00:04:44,400
Back in our village, everybody said
I was creepy, or I smelled bad.

58
00:04:44,700 --> 00:04:49,120
My Bro was the only one who hung out
with me and didn't make fun of me.

59
00:04:49,830 --> 00:04:53,120
He was tough,
and kind, and big.

60
00:04:53,620 --> 00:04:56,250
I wanted to become the kind
of man that Kamina was.

61
00:04:56,420 --> 00:05:00,040
I tried, but it was no use.

62
00:05:00,710 --> 00:05:04,510
I can never be like Kamina.

63
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:06,550
These are really good!

64
00:05:06,840 --> 00:05:08,590
R-Really?

65
00:05:09,300 --> 00:05:12,140
Can I stay and watch
for a while longer?

66
00:05:12,310 --> 00:05:13,680
Sure...

67
00:05:15,020 --> 00:05:16,600
Please help us!

68
00:05:16,690 --> 00:05:20,730
Our village is under attack
by Gunmen!

69
00:05:20,860 --> 00:05:23,780
Someone!
Someone, please help us!

70
00:05:24,690 --> 00:05:29,030
The Gunmen are almost
upon us! Aieeee!

71
00:05:30,280 --> 00:05:32,950
This is terrible!
Let's go help them at once!

72
00:05:33,080 --> 00:05:35,450
I guess I can pinpoint
their location, but...

73
00:05:35,710 --> 00:05:37,960
But this is awfully fishy.

74
00:05:38,500 --> 00:05:39,960
It stinks? It smells?

75
00:05:40,040 --> 00:05:43,630
For one thing, the enemy is sure to have
picked up that transmission, too.

76
00:05:43,710 --> 00:05:46,720
And would people living underground
have equipment like that?

77
00:05:46,840 --> 00:05:50,760
Shut up, shut up!
Don't worry about the details!

78
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:54,930
Do you want those babes' village to get
wiped out while we're standing around?!

79
00:05:55,060 --> 00:05:58,730
He'd set out without a moment's hesitation!
That's what Kamina would do if he was here!

80
00:06:05,400 --> 00:06:08,070
That's right.
He wouldn't hesitate.

81
00:06:08,200 --> 00:06:09,780
That's for sure.

82
00:06:09,860 --> 00:06:11,160
Right!

83
00:06:11,200 --> 00:06:13,620
Dai-Gurren, move out!

84
00:06:27,300 --> 00:06:29,470
That's the village entrance, huh?

85
00:06:29,550 --> 00:06:32,220
Five Gunmen, huh? And we can't
use our main guns, either...

86
00:06:32,300 --> 00:06:33,930
Fire!

87
00:06:38,180 --> 00:06:42,520
There's a village under there!
Don't open fire, dumbass!

88
00:06:42,980 --> 00:06:44,980
Sorry, I couldn't help myself.

89
00:06:45,070 --> 00:06:47,230
The enemy Gunmen are fleeing.

90
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:50,110
Sweet!
Just as I planned!

91
00:06:51,410 --> 00:06:54,490
All right, let's go see if
the village is safe!

92
00:06:56,950 --> 00:06:59,500
It's nothing but young, hot babes!

93
00:06:59,960 --> 00:07:01,920
What a dreadful village...

94
00:07:04,380 --> 00:07:08,920
Thank you! Because of you,
our village has been saved!

95
00:07:09,010 --> 00:07:13,050
There's no need to thank us. After all,
the Spiral King is everyone's enemy.

96
00:07:13,510 --> 00:07:17,140
S-Still, from what we've seen, there
doesn't seem to be a single man here.

97
00:07:17,350 --> 00:07:19,220
How, exactly, did that happen?

98
00:07:19,310 --> 00:07:21,770
Well, about that...

99
00:07:24,810 --> 00:07:27,520
Stay right where you are, humans!

100
00:07:27,820 --> 00:07:30,690
I can't believe it! This was
a Beastman trap?

101
00:07:30,780 --> 00:07:32,240
I said it was fishy...

102
00:07:32,360 --> 00:07:33,780
You bastard!

103
00:07:40,580 --> 00:07:43,120
What were you thinking,
you moron?

104
00:07:44,210 --> 00:07:46,540
Dai-Gunzan has been secured.

105
00:07:46,920 --> 00:07:50,420
We will now begin searching for Nia
and the miniature Gunmen.

106
00:07:50,550 --> 00:07:53,340
Very well. Put your backs
into it.

107
00:07:53,470 --> 00:07:54,890
Yes, sir.

108
00:07:57,100 --> 00:08:01,730
Beastmen are their enemy, so they
assume all humans will be their allies.

109
00:08:01,850 --> 00:08:03,480
What a bunch of fools...

110
00:08:04,600 --> 00:08:09,400
It looks to me like they don't even
know who their #1 enemy is.

111
00:08:11,320 --> 00:08:13,570
Don't resist, punk!

112
00:08:13,650 --> 00:08:15,740
You there!
You're Princess Nia, aren't you?

113
00:08:15,820 --> 00:08:18,120
General Guame says that
he wants to see you.

114
00:08:18,490 --> 00:08:21,790
Guame? Very well,
I will see him.

115
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:25,080
Just don't hurt this boy.

116
00:08:25,290 --> 00:08:28,250
Relax, we haven't been given
orders to kill anyone. Yet.

117
00:08:28,340 --> 00:08:29,340
N-Nia!

118
00:08:29,420 --> 00:08:31,090
Stay put!

119
00:08:31,260 --> 00:08:34,510
Don't worry about me.
I will be fine.

120
00:08:34,720 --> 00:08:36,220
Nia...

121
00:08:37,010 --> 00:08:38,220
Simon.

122
00:08:38,600 --> 00:08:43,140
You aren't your Bro, Simon.
I think you should just be yourself.

123
00:08:48,270 --> 00:08:50,360
You're with me.
Come on.

124
00:08:52,360 --> 00:08:53,650
Nia...

125
00:08:53,740 --> 00:08:56,450
Damn it, let go of me, you furballs!

126
00:08:56,530 --> 00:09:01,330
That's humans for you, no manners.
That's MISTER Furball to you.

127
00:09:01,910 --> 00:09:05,660
I am Guame, the Immovable,
one of the Four Generals!

128
00:09:05,750 --> 00:09:08,170
I'm taking back Dai-Gunzan.

129
00:09:08,250 --> 00:09:12,460
I'm going to execute you publicly
as a warning to the others.

130
00:09:12,550 --> 00:09:15,420
Stay put in here
until we're ready for you!

131
00:09:19,010 --> 00:09:22,930
The Spiral King has issued
orders to eliminate you.

132
00:09:23,060 --> 00:09:26,230
Then what Adiane said is true?

133
00:09:26,520 --> 00:09:28,310
It is indeed.

134
00:09:28,400 --> 00:09:33,480
If you'd died in your sleep in that box in
the valley, it would have been painless.

135
00:09:37,450 --> 00:09:43,080
His Majesty is imbued with immortality.
He's lived for a thousand years or so.

136
00:09:43,410 --> 00:09:46,370
Creating and raising children
is a pastime for him.

137
00:09:46,460 --> 00:09:48,620
When he grows tired of one,
he disposes of it.

138
00:09:48,710 --> 00:09:50,710
Just like he would a doll.

139
00:09:50,790 --> 00:09:52,750
That's all it is.

140
00:09:55,010 --> 00:09:56,920
Like a doll?

141
00:09:59,180 --> 00:10:04,470
I'm told that you asked him,
"Why was I born?"

142
00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:09,060
That was a bad move. His Majesty
detests human self-awareness.

143
00:10:09,150 --> 00:10:14,270
Who can blame him? Why would a puppet,
a plaything, need self-awareness?

144
00:10:18,530 --> 00:10:22,160
I am just like that doll...

145
00:10:25,080 --> 00:10:29,910
Truth be told, though,
you are far too lovely to kill.

146
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:34,250
I've given some thought to the matter
of finding a way that you might live.

147
00:10:35,710 --> 00:10:39,260
Would you be interested in becoming
chief of this village?

148
00:10:39,380 --> 00:10:40,880
Its chief?

149
00:10:40,970 --> 00:10:46,720
Indeed. After all, the girls here
are from villages far and wide.

150
00:10:46,890 --> 00:10:53,730
Someone needs to teach them proper
etiquette before they're sent off to the king.

151
00:10:53,860 --> 00:10:58,030
To what end? What becomes of them
after they are sent away?

152
00:10:58,110 --> 00:11:01,150
The Spiral King lavishes them
with his affections.

153
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:02,990
It's a fair exchange, isn't it?

154
00:11:03,070 --> 00:11:08,410
They get to experience luxury that they
would never know living underground.

155
00:11:11,750 --> 00:11:15,880
The girls who are sent away,
they're more dolls, aren't they?

156
00:11:16,090 --> 00:11:19,590
That's right. And once he grows tired
of them, they're discarded.

157
00:11:19,670 --> 00:11:22,300
Just like you were!

158
00:11:36,520 --> 00:11:40,030
<font color=#FFC9B9>Gurren Lagann</font>

159
00:11:41,530 --> 00:11:45,030
<font color=#FFC9B9>Gurren Lagann</font>

160
00:11:51,830 --> 00:11:54,580
Don't underestimate folks who
were raised underground!

161
00:11:57,380 --> 00:12:00,130
We'll bust outta this place
in no time flat!

162
00:12:02,970 --> 00:12:04,510
That hurt...

163
00:12:05,640 --> 00:12:08,890
Head hurt...!

164
00:12:08,970 --> 00:12:11,470
It's no use! People are getting hurt
with nothing to show for it!

165
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:15,600
This bedrock is incredibly tough!
I've never seen anything like it!

166
00:12:17,730 --> 00:12:20,940
It's hopeless... Our bodies will
give out before that rock will.

167
00:12:21,070 --> 00:12:23,740
After all that, we haven't
so much as scratched it.

168
00:12:23,820 --> 00:12:25,990
It's enough to make you despair...

169
00:12:26,120 --> 00:12:27,660
Is this the end?

170
00:12:27,740 --> 00:12:31,290
If only Kamina was here...

171
00:12:57,730 --> 00:13:00,060
So, this is what he meant.

172
00:13:01,610 --> 00:13:03,530
Kamina said something
to me once.

173
00:13:03,690 --> 00:13:06,450
"He's always the one
who saves my ass."

174
00:13:06,570 --> 00:13:10,030
"He's always the one
who never gives up."

175
00:13:10,490 --> 00:13:11,950
He said that?

176
00:13:14,040 --> 00:13:18,960
My confidence was shot. I thought we
were heading in the wrong direction.

177
00:13:19,340 --> 00:13:23,880
I freaked out. "Why did my dad
make it and I can't?"

178
00:13:24,220 --> 00:13:26,420
Honestly, I was just acting tough.

179
00:13:27,220 --> 00:13:30,220
Everyone was whining,
and they stopped digging.

180
00:13:30,350 --> 00:13:33,310
I was at the end of my rope.

181
00:13:33,850 --> 00:13:36,770
But Simon kept on drilling away.

182
00:13:37,350 --> 00:13:39,770
His drilling let me
put on a brave face.

183
00:13:40,150 --> 00:13:44,030
By dumb luck, he broke through
the last boulder right then.

184
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:46,070
We got lucky.

185
00:13:46,200 --> 00:13:51,740
But I have faith in that luck,
and in Simon, who brought us that luck.

186
00:13:52,160 --> 00:13:56,500
Whenever I feel timid and weak,
whenever I feel like I'm losing confidence,

187
00:13:56,620 --> 00:13:59,960
...I think back to the sight of his back
all hunched over, digging away.

188
00:14:00,420 --> 00:14:04,380
I think to myself, "I'll be a man that
won't be laughed at by that back."

189
00:14:05,880 --> 00:14:09,800
Listen, Simon. Never forget this.
Believe in yourself.

190
00:14:10,300 --> 00:14:12,180
Not in the Simon
that I have faith in.

191
00:14:12,390 --> 00:14:14,430
Not in the Kamina
that you believe in, either.

192
00:14:14,850 --> 00:14:17,640
- Believe in the Simon--
- ...who believes in you!

193
00:14:31,200 --> 00:14:32,490
Lagann?

194
00:14:36,160 --> 00:14:37,620
Lagann!

195
00:14:39,620 --> 00:14:43,630
Huh? Was there a hole
here before?

196
00:14:45,250 --> 00:14:49,590
General Guame, there's no sign of the
miniature Gunmen anywhere on the ship!

197
00:14:49,720 --> 00:14:53,260
Don't give me that!
It has to be here somewhere!

198
00:14:53,350 --> 00:14:55,760
Rip out the armor plating
if you have to, just find it!

199
00:14:55,890 --> 00:14:57,430
Y-Yes, sir!

200
00:14:58,270 --> 00:15:00,690
Why are you in such
a panic, Guame?

201
00:15:00,770 --> 00:15:01,770
What?

202
00:15:01,850 --> 00:15:04,310
You're afraid of him, aren't you?
You're scared of Simon.

203
00:15:04,570 --> 00:15:06,820
Huh? Who is that?

204
00:15:06,900 --> 00:15:10,190
Simon is the boy who first helped me
when I came down to the surface.

205
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:12,660
Not only that, he is the boy who
always protects me when I need him.

206
00:15:13,280 --> 00:15:15,620
He will never lose
to the likes of you!

207
00:15:15,700 --> 00:15:18,750
Ah, I see. He's that thing's
operator, is he?

208
00:15:18,870 --> 00:15:22,870
Hey! Find the boy named Simon
among the prisoners and bring him to me!

209
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:23,670
Yes, sir!

210
00:15:23,750 --> 00:15:26,750
- And the preparations for the executions?
- Everything is ready.

211
00:15:26,840 --> 00:15:30,800
Excellent. The first one we will
put to death is this Simon boy.

212
00:15:32,260 --> 00:15:34,300
I won't let you do it!

213
00:15:35,010 --> 00:15:37,970
I'm the one who gets to
decide such things.

214
00:15:38,060 --> 00:15:42,480
Be a good little discarded doll
and do what I tell you to do!

215
00:15:42,770 --> 00:15:43,690
I will not.

216
00:15:44,560 --> 00:15:49,820
You don't say? In that case,
you'll have to die, too.

217
00:15:49,860 --> 00:15:50,940
I will not!

218
00:15:51,070 --> 00:15:51,780
Oh?

219
00:15:51,860 --> 00:15:54,360
I may be just another
cast-off doll,

220
00:15:54,450 --> 00:15:56,410
...but I have learned one thing
since coming to the surface!

221
00:15:56,490 --> 00:15:57,580
And what's that?

222
00:15:57,660 --> 00:16:01,370
Just as Simon believed in his Bro,
I believe in Simon!

223
00:16:02,290 --> 00:16:06,420
So, you won't yield, not even at
the bitter end. You're too naive.

224
00:16:06,540 --> 00:16:10,050
I've lost interest in you.
I've no need for you!

225
00:16:14,930 --> 00:16:16,470
W-What the--?

226
00:16:16,720 --> 00:16:18,850
Gramps? What are you
doing here?

227
00:16:28,570 --> 00:16:31,570
Nia! I'm here to rescue you!
Come on!

228
00:16:35,030 --> 00:16:36,450
Simon!

229
00:16:37,700 --> 00:16:40,330
Come with us--
Huh?

230
00:16:40,450 --> 00:16:41,580
Why, you!

231
00:16:42,330 --> 00:16:43,500
Come back here!

232
00:16:43,620 --> 00:16:45,160
General Guame!

233
00:16:45,830 --> 00:16:48,960
Follow that mini Gunmen!

234
00:16:51,760 --> 00:16:53,420
I'm sorry I took so long.

235
00:16:53,510 --> 00:16:54,510
That's okay.

236
00:16:55,010 --> 00:16:58,180
I figured it out.
Lagann told me, too.

237
00:16:58,260 --> 00:16:59,760
I understand now!

238
00:17:00,100 --> 00:17:03,060
So do I.
Thank you, Simon!

239
00:17:09,570 --> 00:17:12,320
Simon, move your hands.

240
00:17:17,160 --> 00:17:18,610
Now.

241
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:23,950
Yeah!

242
00:17:25,960 --> 00:17:27,420
This is why...

243
00:17:27,920 --> 00:17:32,130
...I always say humans
are savages!

244
00:17:37,220 --> 00:17:38,470
Oh, crap!

245
00:17:38,760 --> 00:17:46,230
<b>Guame Custom Gunmen:
Gember</b>

246
00:17:39,140 --> 00:17:41,850
Consider the tables turned, humans!

247
00:17:41,850 --> 00:17:46,230
You've thrown a wrench into my plans,
but I'm going to execute you myself!

248
00:17:49,440 --> 00:17:52,440
The sight of my
mighty Gember...

249
00:17:52,780 --> 00:17:55,650
...and that of your own miserable
deaths will be projected...

250
00:17:55,780 --> 00:17:59,320
...above the heads of every
human on the surface!

251
00:17:59,530 --> 00:18:01,450
Say what, you bastard?!

252
00:18:01,530 --> 00:18:03,200
I'm the one you're going to fight!

253
00:18:03,290 --> 00:18:06,830
You think that little thing
is any match for my Gember?

254
00:18:15,960 --> 00:18:17,800
What's the matter?

255
00:18:23,350 --> 00:18:24,810
Gurren's being eaten!

256
00:18:26,270 --> 00:18:29,520
Take that! And that!
Just a little more!

257
00:18:31,610 --> 00:18:33,400
- Rossiu!
- Simon?

258
00:18:33,480 --> 00:18:34,520
Let's combine!

259
00:18:35,150 --> 00:18:36,530
Right!

260
00:18:40,030 --> 00:18:42,620
Damn it ! It's that
mini Gunmen!

261
00:18:45,410 --> 00:18:49,910
I don't believe it! This is the
Gurren Lagann I've heard about?

262
00:18:51,500 --> 00:18:54,170
My Bro is dead.
He's gone.

263
00:18:54,550 --> 00:19:00,090
But he's on my back! In my heart!
He lives on as part of me!

264
00:19:03,720 --> 00:19:05,720
If you're gonna dig,
dig to breach the heavens.

265
00:19:05,810 --> 00:19:08,020
Even if it's my own grave
I'm digging, I keep going!

266
00:19:08,100 --> 00:19:10,560
Once I've dug my way through,
that means I've won!

267
00:19:10,890 --> 00:19:13,480
What? What are you
talking about?

268
00:19:13,610 --> 00:19:15,480
Who the hell do
you think I am?

269
00:19:16,020 --> 00:19:17,820
I'm Simon.

270
00:19:17,900 --> 00:19:21,240
I'm not my Bro, Kamina.
I'm ME!

271
00:19:21,660 --> 00:19:23,660
Simon the Digger!

272
00:19:29,500 --> 00:19:31,580
Spare me your ranting!

273
00:19:32,960 --> 00:19:35,420
Gember Press!

274
00:19:43,510 --> 00:19:45,600
Finishing Move!

275
00:19:49,350 --> 00:19:50,680
That move, it was--

276
00:20:01,070 --> 00:20:08,830
GIGA DRILL BREAK!!

277
00:20:27,890 --> 00:20:30,510
Retreat!
Sound the retreat!

278
00:20:36,190 --> 00:20:42,070
Simon, there's someplace that
I'd like you to take me.

279
00:20:45,110 --> 00:20:48,490
These are all princesses who
were thrown away like I was.

280
00:20:49,910 --> 00:20:52,950
Generation after generation of
princesses who came before me.

281
00:20:53,080 --> 00:20:55,000
ALL of these?

282
00:20:56,210 --> 00:21:00,800
I'd like to give them all
a proper burial in a sunny place.

283
00:21:00,880 --> 00:21:02,460
Please.

284
00:21:02,550 --> 00:21:04,760
- Yeah!
- You got it!

285
00:21:07,010 --> 00:21:10,680
To me, Father was
my entire world.

286
00:21:10,890 --> 00:21:15,390
My whole life, I'd believed in no one but him.
Relied on no one but him.

287
00:21:15,690 --> 00:21:21,150
That's why I wanted to believe
in him until the very end.

288
00:21:25,650 --> 00:21:29,620
Why do you suppose
we were born?

289
00:21:30,200 --> 00:21:32,120
Nia, here.

290
00:21:36,460 --> 00:21:40,460
You can have it. I found it
while I was digging.

291
00:21:43,210 --> 00:21:44,960
It's lovely!

292
00:21:45,970 --> 00:21:49,840
It's hard to explain, but it doesn't matter why
you were born or if you were a princess.

293
00:21:49,970 --> 00:21:52,810
Right here and now,
that's the Nia you are.

294
00:21:52,890 --> 00:21:55,730
That's why you should
go on being yourself.

295
00:21:56,940 --> 00:21:59,810
And I'll live my life
as myself, too.

296
00:22:00,360 --> 00:22:03,650
Yeah, that's more like it.
That's the Team Dai-Gurren way.

297
00:22:03,730 --> 00:22:05,570
Ain't that right, Leader?

298
00:22:07,650 --> 00:22:12,030
You're the man that Kamina
picked for the job, all right.

299
00:22:12,160 --> 00:22:15,620
That name you gave yourself
is pretty half-assed, though.

300
00:22:15,750 --> 00:22:18,410
What? H-Hey, come on!

301
00:22:18,540 --> 00:22:21,750
Yeah, you're right!
That needs a little work!

302
00:22:23,630 --> 00:22:25,630
