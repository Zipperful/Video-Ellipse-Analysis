1
00:00:10,670 --> 00:00:15,470
Gurren Lagann

2
00:00:15,470 --> 00:00:20,780
<font color=#FFFF00>Sugita kisetsu wo nageku hima ha nai
</font>I don't have the time to lament the seasons that have passed

3
00:00:20,780 --> 00:00:26,350
<font color=#FFFF00>Nido to mayotte shimawanu you ni
</font>So that I won't ever waver again

4
00:00:26,350 --> 00:00:31,660
<font color=#FFFF00>Kazoekirenai hon no sasayaka na
</font>With countless, tiny little

5
00:00:31,660 --> 00:00:36,560
<font color=#FFFF00>Sonna koukai kakaeta mama
</font>Regrets carried in my arms

6
00:00:36,660 --> 00:00:42,640
<font color=#FFFF00>Sono senaka dake oikakete koko made kitanda
</font>I've come this far, having chased only after your back

7
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:48,040
<font color=#FFFF00>Sagashite ita boku dake ni dekiru koto
</font>It's something only I, who sought you, can do

8
00:00:48,100 --> 00:00:53,110
<font color=#FFFF00>Ano hi kureta kotoba ga ima demo
</font>Those words you gave me that day, even now,

9
00:00:53,200 --> 00:00:58,940
<font color=#FFFF00>Kono mune ni tashika ni todoite iru kara
</font>Definitely reach my heart

10
00:00:59,050 --> 00:01:04,210
<font color=#FFFF00>Kinou yori mo kyou ha bu ha boku no
</font>I've realized my reason for having been born

11
00:01:04,250 --> 00:01:09,960
<font color=#FFFF00>Umarete kita wake ni kidzuite yuku
</font>Today more than I did yesterday

12
00:01:10,100 --> 00:01:18,830
<font color=#FFFF00>Kotae ha sou itsumo koko ni aru
</font>The answer, yes, is always right here

13
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:35,920
This is the tale of a man who continues
to look for his own path,

14
00:01:36,010 --> 00:01:38,800
...even while he is being
betrayed by fate.

15
00:01:39,260 --> 00:01:42,810
Two weeks remain until the moon
slams into the Earth's surface.

16
00:01:43,180 --> 00:01:45,640
To quell the panic
of the populace,

17
00:01:45,770 --> 00:01:48,890
...Rossiu pursues charges of
war crimes against Simon.

18
00:01:49,190 --> 00:01:51,440
Simon is sentenced
to death.

19
00:01:51,820 --> 00:01:53,820
After his final mission
in Gurren Lagann,

20
00:01:54,190 --> 00:01:58,070
...what does he find waiting for him
in the prison he is sent to?

21
00:01:59,990 --> 00:02:04,330
Welcome to prison,
Supreme Commander Simon.

22
00:02:04,660 --> 00:02:07,660
Oh, right. You aren't Supreme
Commander anymore, are you?

23
00:02:07,790 --> 00:02:09,960
Now you're Simon the war criminal.

24
00:02:10,790 --> 00:02:13,460
We still get news from the
outside world in here.

25
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:15,920
It's interesting,
don't you think, Simon?

26
00:02:16,210 --> 00:02:19,930
Both the Beastman rebel and the
hero of the human liberation...

27
00:02:20,430 --> 00:02:24,100
...are imprisoned as equals
thanks to those "trials" of yours.

28
00:02:24,890 --> 00:02:28,430
Human wisdom has its moments.

29
00:02:31,230 --> 00:02:33,020
Two more weeks...

30
00:02:42,910 --> 00:02:44,950
What... is this?

31
00:02:45,160 --> 00:02:50,910
<b>Episode 20:
How Far Will God Test Us?</b>

32
00:02:56,550 --> 00:03:00,470
Evacuation percentage of all
Gekorn region areas, 68%.

33
00:03:00,840 --> 00:03:03,390
Sakunga region, 32%.

34
00:03:03,640 --> 00:03:06,220
Behama region, 44%.

35
00:03:06,470 --> 00:03:10,930
In the remaining 6 days, 18 hours,
evacuation will be 98% complete.

36
00:03:11,230 --> 00:03:15,650
Evacuation of Kamina City residents
aboard the Arc-Gurren is at 58%.

37
00:03:16,070 --> 00:03:17,110
It is proceeding smoothly.

38
00:03:17,480 --> 00:03:19,860
Leeron, what is the moon's status?

39
00:03:20,360 --> 00:03:22,030
Falling slowly.

40
00:03:22,160 --> 00:03:25,570
Current calculations show it will
make atmospheric entry...

41
00:03:25,700 --> 00:03:28,200
...in 10 days, 6 hours,
and 23 minutes.

42
00:03:28,330 --> 00:03:31,120
The moon will also begin to affect
the surface as it gets closer.

43
00:03:31,250 --> 00:03:33,920
Let's get everyone into their
shelters as soon as possible.

44
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,330
Yes, sir.

45
00:03:35,630 --> 00:03:39,550
You wear the mantle of leader well,
Supreme Commander Rossiu.

46
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:44,510
That doesn't matter. I'm doing what
must be done, nothing more.

47
00:03:44,760 --> 00:03:48,390
My goodness!
You've grown into quite a man.

48
00:03:48,680 --> 00:03:51,520
Would you care to join me
on a date?

49
00:03:51,890 --> 00:03:54,310
There's something I'd like
to tell you in person.

50
00:03:54,520 --> 00:03:57,230
That's right.
Okay, I'll be waiting.

51
00:03:59,610 --> 00:04:03,200
I just hope he doesn't
get burned out.

52
00:04:04,910 --> 00:04:10,160
Even if we eat, the moon's gonna hit
pretty soon and end everything, right?

53
00:04:10,250 --> 00:04:12,750
Yeah, we have some Supreme Commander
to thank for that.

54
00:04:12,830 --> 00:04:14,210
I won't turn down
the food, though.

55
00:04:14,290 --> 00:04:17,420
Save us once again, o mighty
Supreme Commander!

56
00:04:17,500 --> 00:04:20,130
I hear the people outside have
been evacuated underground.

57
00:04:30,430 --> 00:04:31,770
What the--?

58
00:04:34,310 --> 00:04:35,440
Who the hell are you?

59
00:04:35,810 --> 00:04:38,480
I'll avenge
General Cytomander's death!

60
00:04:38,610 --> 00:04:41,820
Cytomander? One of the Spiral King's
Four Generals?

61
00:04:41,900 --> 00:04:48,740
That's right! If you hadn't killed him,
I'd still be flying in the sky right now!

62
00:04:49,080 --> 00:04:51,740
Look at what they've
done to me!

63
00:04:51,830 --> 00:04:54,830
When they locked me in here,
they cut my wings off!

64
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:58,540
I'm pathetic!
I'm a disgrace!

65
00:04:58,630 --> 00:05:01,300
And it's all your fault, Simon!

66
00:05:10,010 --> 00:05:11,680
DIE!

67
00:05:15,020 --> 00:05:17,100
V-Viral...

68
00:05:17,560 --> 00:05:20,270
The weaker the bird,
the shriller the squawking.

69
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:22,650
Why don't you shut your beak
for a while?

70
00:05:22,730 --> 00:05:26,400
You're siding with Simon, you bastard?
And you call yourself a Beastman?!

71
00:05:26,530 --> 00:05:31,950
It's BECAUSE I'm a Beastman that the sight
of pathetic Beastmen makes me sick!

72
00:05:36,710 --> 00:05:38,830
Oh, how the mighty naked ape
has fallen.

73
00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:39,750
What?

74
00:05:39,880 --> 00:05:43,840
You've lost Gurren Lagann, you've lost your
woman, and you've lost your friends.

75
00:05:43,920 --> 00:05:46,590
Now that you've gone back to
being just another naked ape,

76
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:49,680
...you can't even
protect yourself?

77
00:05:49,800 --> 00:05:50,840
What did you say?!

78
00:05:51,510 --> 00:05:55,100
Even barehanded,
Kamina held his own against me.

79
00:05:55,350 --> 00:05:56,600
Shut up!

80
00:05:56,850 --> 00:05:59,480
Oh, is that anger
I see in your eyes?

81
00:05:59,810 --> 00:06:02,310
If you don't like it,
do something about it!

82
00:06:10,910 --> 00:06:11,910
What the--?

83
00:06:13,700 --> 00:06:15,700
Hey, it's a fight!
It's a fight!

84
00:06:17,080 --> 00:06:19,250
So, you're not entirely helpless
after all.

85
00:06:19,370 --> 00:06:21,420
What's wrong, Viral?
Kill him!

86
00:06:21,500 --> 00:06:23,210
Get him, get him!

87
00:06:26,050 --> 00:06:29,930
He's MY prey!
Back off!

88
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:40,980
How did you--

89
00:06:41,060 --> 00:06:43,690
My new, immortal body,
given to me by the Spiral King...

90
00:06:43,770 --> 00:06:46,020
...with the order to
forever bear witness.

91
00:06:46,480 --> 00:06:48,690
After all that, what I have
to bear witness to...

92
00:06:48,950 --> 00:06:51,700
...is a pathetic specimen like you
reduced to fighting in a towel in prison?

93
00:06:51,780 --> 00:06:52,990
This is too much.

94
00:06:53,070 --> 00:06:57,620
What do you know about it?
I'm just doing what I need to do!

95
00:06:59,250 --> 00:07:01,290
That's a good one!

96
00:07:01,710 --> 00:07:04,710
So, doing nothing is what
you "need" to do, huh?

97
00:07:05,040 --> 00:07:08,340
Now you're finally the same
as the Spiral King!

98
00:07:08,970 --> 00:07:10,720
Take that back!

99
00:07:11,430 --> 00:07:16,140
Is that the future you won for
yourselves by destroying us?

100
00:07:16,220 --> 00:07:19,270
It's unforgivable!

101
00:07:19,520 --> 00:07:21,520
I never asked for your forgiveness!

102
00:07:21,640 --> 00:07:24,440
Those two bastards treat me
like I'm nothing!

103
00:07:24,610 --> 00:07:27,020
- Quit your yammering!
- Shut up!

104
00:07:28,650 --> 00:07:31,990
The two of you are dead men!

105
00:07:33,070 --> 00:07:35,950
No fighting!
No fighting allowed!

106
00:07:36,120 --> 00:07:38,240
Who's the one
who started this?!

107
00:07:38,330 --> 00:07:39,740
- Those two!
- Those two, sir!

108
00:07:39,830 --> 00:07:42,330
Those two ganged up on
that poor bird man!

109
00:07:53,760 --> 00:07:57,180
How far does goes God
intend to test us?

110
00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:00,970
I can understand how you
don't want to believe it.

111
00:08:01,060 --> 00:08:04,940
If you don't want to believe, don't.
This is a simulation, after all.

112
00:08:05,310 --> 00:08:08,270
In my position now, I have
no choice BUT to believe.

113
00:08:09,110 --> 00:08:12,860
Was it wrong for humanity to dream
of living on the surface?

114
00:08:13,030 --> 00:08:16,870
Are we humans so sinful a species
that we don't deserve even that?

115
00:08:16,990 --> 00:08:20,620
It's the Anti-Spiral
who see it that way.

116
00:08:20,870 --> 00:08:24,250
God's will has nothing
to do with this.

117
00:08:30,590 --> 00:08:32,170
Hey.

118
00:08:33,470 --> 00:08:35,220
Things going smoothly here?

119
00:08:35,340 --> 00:08:38,720
In terms of overall progress,
we're 48% behind.

120
00:08:41,100 --> 00:08:45,140
Wow, that really takes me back!
It's some warble runners!

121
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:48,900
Boy, you were terrified of
riding those at first.

122
00:08:50,190 --> 00:08:54,900
Hey, it's some slime grape hippos
and pig-moles!

123
00:08:55,030 --> 00:08:59,070
What's the deal? It's the humans
we need to get on board, not those.

124
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:02,330
Is Rossiu planning to open
a zoo or something?

125
00:09:08,130 --> 00:09:10,540
Now hooking up
the Lordgenome Head.

126
00:09:10,750 --> 00:09:13,510
This used to be the Spiral King.
Are you sure there is no danger?

127
00:09:13,970 --> 00:09:16,420
Even if there is,
we have no choice.

128
00:09:16,510 --> 00:09:20,600
The Arc-Gurren activates
by recognizing his bio-signature.

129
00:09:20,680 --> 00:09:23,850
It's like how Lagann won't work
unless Simon is on board.

130
00:09:23,930 --> 00:09:28,650
Even so, what if this biocomputer turns out
to contain Lordgenome's personality?

131
00:09:28,730 --> 00:09:30,150
You're quite the worrywart,
aren't you?

132
00:09:30,230 --> 00:09:34,360
In that case, all you have to do is
strap on a bomb and sit down next to it.

133
00:09:34,440 --> 00:09:37,360
If you have Kinon's courage,
that is.

134
00:09:37,820 --> 00:09:40,950
If this doesn't work,
it's more all-nighters for us.

135
00:09:41,030 --> 00:09:43,620
I haven't had a good night's sleep
these past seven years, anyway.

136
00:09:44,120 --> 00:09:46,450
Okay, everything's hooked up.

137
00:09:46,580 --> 00:09:51,000
Arc-Gurren Spiral Engine!
Begin final activation checklist!

138
00:09:51,170 --> 00:09:53,340
You got it! Activating!

139
00:09:54,710 --> 00:09:56,720
You moron, not yet!

140
00:10:05,980 --> 00:10:08,980
Super Spiral Engine
startup complete.

141
00:10:09,270 --> 00:10:11,270
Oh, I guess it worked.

142
00:10:11,400 --> 00:10:13,520
For me, nothing is impossible.

143
00:10:13,650 --> 00:10:16,610
You sure talk big for someone
who's just a head.

144
00:10:16,690 --> 00:10:19,200
Anyway, I guess
that's everything!

145
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:24,030
Congratulations. I will notify Supreme
Commander Rossiu at once.

146
00:10:28,540 --> 00:10:30,620
Legal Affairs Chief Kittan.

147
00:10:33,920 --> 00:10:35,710
W-What are you doing?

148
00:10:35,840 --> 00:10:38,210
You're one of Rossiu's
top ass-kissers.

149
00:10:38,340 --> 00:10:41,800
You're gonna tell me what
he's thinking, Guinble.

150
00:10:41,890 --> 00:10:43,470
I-I have no idea
what you mean.

151
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:47,640
Don't play dumb with me! How come you're
loading animals aboard the Arc-Gurren?

152
00:10:47,930 --> 00:10:50,350
A whole lot of 'em, too.
Why's that?

153
00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:51,850
I-I don't know.

154
00:10:52,190 --> 00:10:53,980
If you won't talk,
let me take a guess.

155
00:10:54,070 --> 00:10:56,480
Something bad's gonna happen
to the surface, right?

156
00:10:56,610 --> 00:10:59,030
And that's why our softhearted
Rossiu decided to save...

157
00:10:59,150 --> 00:11:01,780
...even the poor, helpless animals,
is that it?!

158
00:11:03,490 --> 00:11:05,200
So, I'm right.

159
00:11:05,870 --> 00:11:08,200
Now, then.
Start explaining.

160
00:11:08,250 --> 00:11:09,500
It's--

161
00:11:09,580 --> 00:11:15,210
It's because we will have to live aboard
the Arc-Gurren for one year.

162
00:11:16,210 --> 00:11:17,210
Rossiu...

163
00:11:17,340 --> 00:11:19,340
You're a key government official.

164
00:11:19,420 --> 00:11:21,880
If that is how you feel,
then shoulder the burden yourself.

165
00:11:22,010 --> 00:11:23,510
Come with me.

166
00:11:28,850 --> 00:11:31,020
W-What the hell is this?

167
00:11:31,140 --> 00:11:34,020
A simulation of what will happen
when the moon hits the Earth.

168
00:11:34,110 --> 00:11:37,980
I'd never calculated anything like this,
so it took a long time to generate it.

169
00:11:38,690 --> 00:11:42,360
But this means... The entire surface
is gonna be wiped out!

170
00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:45,870
Not just the surface.
Underground, too.

171
00:11:46,700 --> 00:11:50,910
The entire surface will be stripped off
by the shock of the moon's impact.

172
00:11:51,210 --> 00:11:55,250
And then the whole world will be
blanketed by white-hot gasses.

173
00:11:55,670 --> 00:11:58,340
Everything on land
will be incinerated.

174
00:11:58,920 --> 00:12:01,840
It won't be capable of supporting life
of any kind for an entire year.

175
00:12:02,300 --> 00:12:05,760
What're you saying, then? You're just
gonna let the people underground die?!

176
00:12:06,140 --> 00:12:08,140
Do you have any other ideas?

177
00:12:08,220 --> 00:12:10,850
The Arc-Gurren can't carry
a million people.

178
00:12:11,350 --> 00:12:14,440
Then... Then why don't we use this
thing to destroy the moon?!

179
00:12:14,770 --> 00:12:16,350
This Dai-Gun is huge!

180
00:12:16,650 --> 00:12:18,310
There's nothing it can't do!

181
00:12:18,570 --> 00:12:21,570
We've considered that, as well.
But it's too risky.

182
00:12:21,650 --> 00:12:24,650
If we fail, humanity will
truly go extinct.

183
00:12:25,240 --> 00:12:28,700
Kittan, are you able to bear
that responsibility?

184
00:12:30,080 --> 00:12:34,000
We will save every life we possibly can.
And not just humans.

185
00:12:34,080 --> 00:12:37,040
What the Arc-Gurren carries within it
will become a second Earth.

186
00:12:37,170 --> 00:12:40,340
We will take aboard every
living beast of the land,

187
00:12:40,420 --> 00:12:43,630
...and live in space for a year
until the Earth cools down.

188
00:12:43,760 --> 00:12:45,510
That is all we can do.

189
00:12:46,220 --> 00:12:50,640
The leader's role isn't to fight. The leader's
role is to make the hard decisions.

190
00:12:51,310 --> 00:12:53,180
Am I wrong?

191
00:12:53,310 --> 00:12:56,440
No... No, you're right!

192
00:12:59,110 --> 00:13:02,900
But that don't mean
I have to like it.

193
00:13:04,570 --> 00:13:08,070
<font color=#FFC9B9>Gurren Lagann</font>

194
00:13:09,620 --> 00:13:13,120
<font color=#FFC9B9>Gurren Lagann</font>

195
00:13:25,340 --> 00:13:27,470
- Hi, brother.
- He's here, he's here!

196
00:13:27,550 --> 00:13:29,220
Nice to finally see you,
Uncle Kittan.

197
00:13:29,300 --> 00:13:33,600
You bet. I gotta see her at least once
while we're still on Earth, right?

198
00:13:33,680 --> 00:13:35,890
You talk like you won't
get another chance.

199
00:13:36,270 --> 00:13:37,350
Is she healthy?

200
00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:40,560
Yep. I'm amazed at how much
she drinks when she nurses.

201
00:13:40,650 --> 00:13:43,480
And when she cries,
you better cover your ears!

202
00:13:43,860 --> 00:13:47,110
Let's have a look... Is it just me,
or does she kinda look worried?

203
00:13:47,240 --> 00:13:48,360
Right here, around
her eyebrows.

204
00:13:48,490 --> 00:13:49,950
Well, maybe...

205
00:13:50,030 --> 00:13:53,540
It's possible. She took after
her father in some odd ways.

206
00:13:53,620 --> 00:13:55,120
Whatever shall we do?

207
00:13:55,200 --> 00:13:57,160
When are you guys
gonna evacuate?

208
00:13:57,460 --> 00:14:00,040
Kiyoh needs to build up
her strength a little more.

209
00:14:00,170 --> 00:14:02,170
I'm worried about
moving her right away.

210
00:14:02,250 --> 00:14:04,170
You dumbass, get aboard
right away!

211
00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:06,800
There's doctors on board
the Arc-Gurren!

212
00:14:06,970 --> 00:14:09,050
Quit wasting time!

213
00:14:12,680 --> 00:14:14,640
Now, now...
That's a good girl...

214
00:14:18,230 --> 00:14:20,730
So, I hear you submitted
your resignation.

215
00:14:21,110 --> 00:14:23,020
Word travels fast.

216
00:14:23,480 --> 00:14:28,650
I know it's a bad time to bail on you,
but I want to be with Kiyoh and Anne.

217
00:14:28,740 --> 00:14:31,320
It's BECAUSE this
is a bad time.

218
00:14:32,030 --> 00:14:35,620
Maybe Kamina picked
the right time to die.

219
00:14:35,740 --> 00:14:37,040
I'm sorry.

220
00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:41,540
But a newborn baby girl is more important
to me right now than a dead man.

221
00:14:42,170 --> 00:14:44,790
It is, huh?
I guess I can't blame you.

222
00:14:48,670 --> 00:14:51,180
Looks like there's a ceiling
in the sky now, too.

223
00:14:51,970 --> 00:14:53,760
Yeah, I guess there is.

224
00:14:54,050 --> 00:14:57,470
Look, uh...
Nah, forget it.

225
00:15:06,280 --> 00:15:07,690
What the hell?!

226
00:15:11,910 --> 00:15:12,530
What happened?

227
00:15:12,620 --> 00:15:16,410
A beam attack from Mugann!
Parliament Tower has been destroyed!

228
00:15:16,830 --> 00:15:18,410
A second wave is coming in!

229
00:15:21,710 --> 00:15:24,330
The attacks are concentrated
underneath Parliament Tower.

230
00:15:24,460 --> 00:15:27,130
I don't believe it, have they detected
the Arc-Gurren's presence?

231
00:15:27,340 --> 00:15:28,550
It's possible.

232
00:15:28,630 --> 00:15:31,670
They might be attacking because they
detected a powerful Spiral Power source.

233
00:15:32,470 --> 00:15:36,140
Is there nothing we can do?
Run a search in the Lordgenome Head!

234
00:15:38,520 --> 00:15:39,430
What's this?

235
00:15:39,520 --> 00:15:41,310
It looks like an energy shield.

236
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:45,100
It's a Spiral Power shield.
This is a Spiral battleship.

237
00:15:45,270 --> 00:15:47,360
Naturally, it is equipped
with a defensive shield.

238
00:15:57,830 --> 00:16:01,120
It's nice to be able to take them out in one
shot, but there's a ton of these things!

239
00:16:02,540 --> 00:16:05,880
It's safe inside the Arc-Gurren! Please
hurry into the underground tunnels!

240
00:16:13,130 --> 00:16:14,430
Is that everyone?

241
00:16:14,550 --> 00:16:16,300
Everyone who's alive.

242
00:16:20,140 --> 00:16:22,020
Aw, crap...
Get going, Dayakka!

243
00:16:22,140 --> 00:16:23,350
What about you?!

244
00:16:24,440 --> 00:16:27,440
These are Spiral shells.
They oughta be able to slow it down.

245
00:16:27,730 --> 00:16:28,820
Brother!

246
00:16:30,070 --> 00:16:33,700
I'm not about to let my cute little
niece die in some alleyway.

247
00:16:33,780 --> 00:16:35,280
Go on without me, Dayakka!

248
00:16:35,530 --> 00:16:37,620
Kiyoh, look after Kinon for me.

249
00:16:42,250 --> 00:16:44,870
Get moving! It's gonna open fire
any second!

250
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:48,460
Brother!

251
00:16:56,340 --> 00:16:57,430
- Brother!
- Brother!

252
00:17:00,470 --> 00:17:02,220
Get clear, Kittan.

253
00:17:02,890 --> 00:17:03,730
Makken?

254
00:17:04,060 --> 00:17:06,730
Sorry, it took a long time
to find a sitter for the kids.

255
00:17:07,100 --> 00:17:09,400
That gives me a good idea
of what your family life is like!

256
00:17:18,570 --> 00:17:20,530
I see you brought some
handy toys to the party!

257
00:17:20,910 --> 00:17:23,450
Barrier missiles we made as
a military subcontractor.

258
00:17:23,580 --> 00:17:25,000
We've been helping
ourselves to a few.

259
00:17:26,120 --> 00:17:27,920
Big brother's okay!

260
00:17:38,140 --> 00:17:39,470
What the--?

261
00:17:40,720 --> 00:17:42,390
Hop aboard, Kittan.

262
00:17:42,470 --> 00:17:44,220
I thought these were destroyed!

263
00:17:44,730 --> 00:17:48,600
Some government types brought them
to our place and said to scrap 'em.

264
00:17:48,810 --> 00:17:51,360
So I took 'em... and kept 'em
in peak condition!

265
00:17:51,690 --> 00:17:54,070
That's our Leyte!
I owe you one!

266
00:17:59,030 --> 00:18:00,620
A ceiling, huh?

267
00:18:00,700 --> 00:18:02,870
Yeah, I guess that's
a ceiling, all right.

268
00:18:19,010 --> 00:18:21,590
All right, bring aboard the evacuees
while the shield is up!

269
00:18:21,720 --> 00:18:23,220
Commander, look at that!

270
00:18:25,390 --> 00:18:27,930
Impossible! What are Gunmen
doing out there?!

271
00:18:28,060 --> 00:18:30,140
Attacks from old Gunmen
are effective against them?

272
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:35,110
Gunmen were originally weapons
designed to fight the Anti-Spiral.

273
00:18:35,190 --> 00:18:38,070
It's only natural that their
weapons would be effective.

274
00:18:38,490 --> 00:18:42,490
Forget about them. Activating the
Arc-Gurren has top priority.

275
00:18:42,780 --> 00:18:47,700
Attention, all units! The Arc-Gurren will
leave the stratosphere in 30 minutes!

276
00:18:48,040 --> 00:18:50,870
Bring aboard as many evacuees
as possible in that time!

277
00:18:51,250 --> 00:18:52,380
Thirty minutes...

278
00:18:52,500 --> 00:18:54,340
In order to exit the stratosphere,

279
00:18:54,420 --> 00:18:58,710
...thirty minutes is the maximum duration
we can divert energy to the shield.

280
00:18:58,800 --> 00:19:00,880
What about the evacuees who
can't get here in time?

281
00:19:06,850 --> 00:19:08,930
We leave in 30 minutes.

282
00:19:09,480 --> 00:19:12,060
My decision is made.

283
00:19:12,230 --> 00:19:15,520
Now I get it.
That's your hard decision, huh?

284
00:19:15,820 --> 00:19:20,320
Save as many lives as you can.
Nothing can shake your resolve.

285
00:19:20,780 --> 00:19:21,950
What are you getting at?

286
00:19:21,990 --> 00:19:24,820
That's a leaderly thing of the
new Government leader to do.

287
00:19:24,910 --> 00:19:27,200
That's impressive for
a boy your age.

288
00:19:27,290 --> 00:19:30,750
But if that's how it's gonna be, how's
about returning the you-know-what?

289
00:19:31,040 --> 00:19:34,290
Me and the guys just don't fit in
with all this government stuff.

290
00:19:34,380 --> 00:19:35,880
We're just Team Gurren.

291
00:19:36,210 --> 00:19:39,840
But the thing is, Team Gurren
has its own way of doing things.

292
00:19:40,050 --> 00:19:43,010
You still don't understand?!
It's a futile effort!

293
00:19:43,090 --> 00:19:47,100
That's what's so great about it.
Now, hand it over.

294
00:19:47,390 --> 00:19:50,770
What you have there is Team Gurren's--
That's HIS soul.

295
00:20:07,580 --> 00:20:11,580
Once upon a time, I entrusted
the future to this, too.

296
00:20:12,290 --> 00:20:15,290
Me, I'm gonna wager tomorrow
on this baby.

297
00:20:17,380 --> 00:20:18,590
Brother...

298
00:20:18,670 --> 00:20:20,050
Survive.

299
00:20:20,880 --> 00:20:23,220
- I'm sorry.
- Leave this to me.

300
00:20:24,590 --> 00:20:28,140
All hands, prepare for liftoff.
We don't have much time!

301
00:20:31,310 --> 00:20:34,810
Move it, move it!
You're in the way!

302
00:20:43,780 --> 00:20:46,320
Let us in!

303
00:21:09,930 --> 00:21:14,140
- Well, it looks like we've been left behind.
- Looks that way.

304
00:21:16,730 --> 00:21:19,310
You did it, Rossiu.

305
00:21:22,030 --> 00:21:26,450
This stinks. To think THIS is how
I'm going to witness your death.

306
00:21:26,530 --> 00:21:28,030
I'm fine with it.

307
00:21:28,320 --> 00:21:31,450
As long as the others will survive,
it's fine with me.

308
00:21:31,830 --> 00:21:33,830
I wouldn't be so sure.

309
00:21:34,200 --> 00:21:35,330
You!

310
00:21:35,460 --> 00:21:38,330
Rossiu has turned his back
on humanity.

311
00:21:41,300 --> 00:21:46,420
When the moon hits, they will be swallowed,
shelters and all, by the Earth's crust,

312
00:21:46,510 --> 00:21:48,130
...and they will
all die.

313
00:21:48,760 --> 00:21:50,680
What the hell is this?

314
00:21:50,760 --> 00:21:52,510
That can't be true!

315
00:21:52,640 --> 00:21:58,980
Even if they do escape into space,
all that awaits them is despair.

316
00:21:59,150 --> 00:22:00,230
What?!

317
00:22:00,360 --> 00:22:04,530
What the Anti-Spiral seek
is absolute despair.

318
00:22:04,610 --> 00:22:07,820
They have taken every step that is
necessary to achieve that aim.

319
00:22:08,160 --> 00:22:11,780
Nia...? Nia, you'd go
that far?

320
00:22:15,370 --> 00:22:17,580
Why, you little...

321
00:22:24,550 --> 00:22:29,300
I don't see you for a while, and you
go and turn into a boring bitch...

322
00:22:30,510 --> 00:22:31,680
...Nia.

323
00:22:31,090 --> 00:22:35,100
To Be Continued...

00:22:54,070 --> 00:22:59,810
<font color=#FFFF00>Sono tane ga kibou no hana wo sakasu ka mo shirenai
</font>That seed might bloom into a flower of hope

</font>A loophole that seems safe comes to mind, but then disappears

330
00:23:11,350 --> 00:23:17,320
<font color=#FFFF00>Sou yatte boku ha tamesarete dou yatte omoi todokeyou?
</font>By doing that, I'm tested; how can I get my feelings across?

331
00:23:17,320 --> 00:23:20,430
<font color=#FFFF00>Mayowazu ni mae he susunde
</font>Let's advance forward without hesitating

332
00:23:20,690 --> 00:23:25,270
<font color=#FFFF00>Dakara kakko tsukenaide motto jibun wo shinjite
</font>So don't try to look cool; believe in yourself more

333
00:23:25,270 --> 00:23:29,800
<font color=#FFFF00>Sono yume wo oikake Love & Rock Love & Rock, Peace!!

<font color=#FFFF00>Bokura ha kagayaku yo Love & Rock Love & Rock, Peace!!
</font>We're gonna shine! Love & Rock, Love & Rock, Peace!!

336

</font>It's OK to harmonize with Love & Rock!

338

<font color=#FFFF00>Minna de utau Song For You
</font>With everybody, I'll sing a song for you!

</font>Love & Peace Rock, my song

344
00:24:05,610 --> 00:24:08,610
<b>Next Time</b>

345
00:24:06,440 --> 00:24:09,400
What that man loved was a future
beneath the blue sky.

346
00:24:09,570 --> 00:24:12,570
And when that sky begins to fall,
she rises up.

347
00:24:12,650 --> 00:24:15,110
And then their intertwined fates
merge and become one.

348
00:24:15,570 --> 00:24:20,620
<b>You Are Someone Who Ought To Survive</b>

349
00:24:15,570 --> 00:24:18,160
Next time on
Gurren Lagann,

350
00:24:18,160 --> 00:24:20,620
..."You Are Someone
Who Ought To Survive."
