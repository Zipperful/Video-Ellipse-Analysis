00:00:10,670 --> 00:00:15,470
Gurren Lagann

2
00:00:15,470 --> 00:00:20,780
<font color=#FFFF00>Sugita kisetsu wo nageku hima ha nai
</font>I don't have the time to lament the seasons that have passed

3
00:00:20,780 --> 00:00:26,350
<font color=#FFFF00>Nido to mayotte shimawanu you ni
</font>So that I won't ever waver again

4
00:00:26,350 --> 00:00:31,660
<font color=#FFFF00>Kazoekirenai hon no sasayaka na
</font>With countless, tiny little

5
00:00:31,660 --> 00:00:36,560
<font color=#FFFF00>Sonna koukai kakaeta mama
</font>Regrets carried in my arms

6
00:00:36,660 --> 00:00:42,640
<font color=#FFFF00>Sono senaka dake oikakete koko made kitanda
</font>I've come this far, having chased only after your back

7
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:48,040
<font color=#FFFF00>Sagashite ita boku dake ni dekiru koto
</font>It's something only I, who sought you, can do

8
00:00:48,100 --> 00:00:53,110
<font color=#FFFF00>Ano hi kureta kotoba ga ima demo
</font>Those words you gave me that day, even now,

9
00:00:53,200 --> 00:00:58,940
<font color=#FFFF00>Kono mune ni tashika ni todoite iru kara
</font>Definitely reach my heart

10
00:00:59,050 --> 00:01:04,210
<font color=#FFFF00>Kinou yori mo kyou ha bu ha boku no
</font>I've realized my reason for having been born

11
00:01:04,250 --> 00:01:09,960
<font color=#FFFF00>Umarete kita wake ni kidzuite yuku
</font>Today more than I did yesterday

12
00:01:10,100 --> 00:01:18,830
<font color=#FFFF00>Kotae ha sou itsumo koko ni aru
</font>The answer, yes, is always right here

13
00:01:31,960 --> 00:01:35,630
This is the tale of a man who continues
to look for his own path,

14
00:01:35,720 --> 00:01:38,430
...even while being
betrayed by fate.

15
00:01:38,550 --> 00:01:40,550
It has been seven years
since Teppelin's fall.

16
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:44,560
Human civilization has evolved
at an astonishing rate.

17
00:01:45,140 --> 00:01:49,600
As Lordgenome predicted, the instant
that the one millionth human was born,

18
00:01:49,940 --> 00:01:52,610
...an unknown destructive
weapon suddenly appeared.

19
00:01:52,940 --> 00:01:57,360
The declaration of war against humanity
came from an unexpected person.

20
00:01:57,650 --> 00:01:59,570
Attention, humans of Earth.

21
00:01:59,860 --> 00:02:05,490
We, the Anti-Spiral races,
have determined that humanity...

22
00:02:05,620 --> 00:02:09,620
...has achieved Spiral Power
danger level two.

23
00:02:10,330 --> 00:02:14,750
We hereby activate the
Humanity Annihilation System.

24
00:02:14,960 --> 00:02:17,760
Is that Nia?

25
00:02:20,430 --> 00:02:26,180
<b>Episode 18:
Tell Me The Secrets of This World</b>

26
00:02:27,480 --> 00:02:28,980
I say again...

27
00:02:29,270 --> 00:02:32,480
The Humanity Annihilation System
has been activated.

28
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:35,230
What the hell is our little
princess talking about?

29
00:02:35,650 --> 00:02:37,480
Hurry, pinpoint the
transmission origin!

30
00:02:37,570 --> 00:02:40,700
It's no use! It's using an encryption
I've never seen before!

31
00:02:40,990 --> 00:02:42,070
Find a way!

32
00:02:42,200 --> 00:02:44,240
Rossiu! Where's Nia?!

33
00:02:44,580 --> 00:02:46,370
That's what I'd like to know!

34
00:02:46,450 --> 00:02:48,040
She's not answering
her cell, either.

35
00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:51,170
Is it really Nia that's saying
all that crazy stuff?!

36
00:02:54,710 --> 00:02:55,790
It shut off...

37
00:03:03,090 --> 00:03:06,390
Yeah, that's right! Trust your friendly
New Government Council!

38
00:03:06,470 --> 00:03:08,850
How could something wipe out
the whole human race?

39
00:03:09,060 --> 00:03:12,980
Huh? What's that? Reimburse you
for your burnt-out house?

40
00:03:13,150 --> 00:03:16,980
You stupid bastard! Gurren Lagann
was fighting to protect the city!

41
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:19,610
What's going on?
It's chaos in here!

42
00:03:19,690 --> 00:03:21,240
Where have you been, Dayakka?!

43
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:24,660
My apologies for calling you in,
Provisions Bureau Chief Dayakka.

44
00:03:25,070 --> 00:03:28,040
That's okay, there's nothing
a new father can do right now.

45
00:03:28,200 --> 00:03:30,080
What are all these
calls about?

46
00:03:30,160 --> 00:03:33,870
The citizens are nervous about
that declaration of war.

47
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:38,380
Speaking to executives of the
New Government, core Team Gurren members,

48
00:03:38,460 --> 00:03:40,550
...will go far in alleviating the
worries of the general public.

49
00:03:40,760 --> 00:03:42,800
That is Chief Advisor Rossiu's
thinking on the matter.

50
00:03:43,090 --> 00:03:46,760
I'm getting more gripes about
smashed houses than nervous citizens.

51
00:03:46,890 --> 00:03:49,310
Everybody's real attached
to their new lifestyles.

52
00:03:49,560 --> 00:03:53,060
- Listen, we tough!
- Quit bitching and let us do job!

53
00:03:57,320 --> 00:03:58,610
Where is he?

54
00:03:58,730 --> 00:04:00,570
Considering how to deal
with the situation.

55
00:04:00,780 --> 00:04:02,570
Please leave all of that
to the Chief Advisor.

56
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:06,700
In other words, keep us old-timers
busy fielding the complaint calls.

57
00:04:06,870 --> 00:04:09,870
Sounds like something that smartass
Rossiu would come up with.

58
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,840
It's a success. We've activated
the bio-computer.

59
00:04:19,340 --> 00:04:22,710
Very well. Good work.
Now, everyone leave the room.

60
00:04:23,010 --> 00:04:25,930
No one is allowed in
until I give authorization.

61
00:04:26,140 --> 00:04:27,340
Very good, sir.

62
00:04:31,640 --> 00:04:36,600
Now, then. This time, you will tell me.
Tell me all this world's secrets.

63
00:04:37,230 --> 00:04:40,520
Wake up, Lordgenome.

64
00:04:53,580 --> 00:04:55,290
Nia, are you here?!

65
00:04:59,340 --> 00:05:00,590
Old Coco?

66
00:05:01,550 --> 00:05:03,260
Have you seen Nia?

67
00:05:11,180 --> 00:05:15,310
Well met. This is Nia.
I can't come to the phone right now.

68
00:05:15,730 --> 00:05:19,730
When I said "I can't come to the phone"
just now, I CAN, I'm just not near mine.

69
00:05:19,980 --> 00:05:25,320
And when I do come home, I prefer to use
the home phone than my cell phone.

70
00:05:27,200 --> 00:05:29,820
Nia, please come home...

71
00:05:32,490 --> 00:05:35,040
We finally found you,
Supreme Commander Simon!

72
00:05:37,500 --> 00:05:39,120
Where do you think
you're going?

73
00:05:39,630 --> 00:05:40,920
Out of my way, Gimmy!

74
00:05:41,040 --> 00:05:43,380
Gurren Lagann has been
ordered back to base.

75
00:05:43,460 --> 00:05:46,970
Besides, all combat has been
prohibited except by Grapearls.

76
00:05:47,430 --> 00:05:49,340
You two were no match
for that thing!

77
00:05:49,430 --> 00:05:51,350
We could have beaten it
by ourselves!

78
00:05:51,550 --> 00:05:55,100
I'm searching for Nia!
This is an emergency! Stand aside!

79
00:05:55,180 --> 00:05:56,180
I won't!

80
00:05:56,270 --> 00:05:57,770
That's an order from the
supreme commander!

81
00:05:57,850 --> 00:06:00,980
Gunmen dispatches fall under
Chief Advisor Rossiu's purview.

82
00:06:01,060 --> 00:06:03,070
Not even the supreme commander
is allowed to ignore the rules.

83
00:06:03,190 --> 00:06:04,440
You little--

84
00:06:04,530 --> 00:06:06,650
The citizens are worried.

85
00:06:06,860 --> 00:06:09,110
Gurren Lagann is no
ordinary Gunmen.

86
00:06:09,240 --> 00:06:12,120
It's a symbol of the retaking of
the surface. A symbol of strength.

87
00:06:12,200 --> 00:06:18,160
If people see it flying around, they might
worry that another big battle is coming.

88
00:06:18,660 --> 00:06:20,830
That isn't something
you would do, Simon.

89
00:06:22,840 --> 00:06:25,460
You sure can make a
persuasive case these days, Darry.

90
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:32,300
You win. Take Gurren back with you.
I'll go in Lagann.

91
00:06:32,550 --> 00:06:34,930
I won't draw any attention
in this, right?

92
00:06:35,260 --> 00:06:36,720
Commander Simon!

93
00:06:36,890 --> 00:06:40,390
Gimmy, don't bother. Nobody can
stop him when he gets like that.

94
00:06:40,600 --> 00:06:44,520
I swear... I wish he'd hurry up and
realize that the times have changed.

95
00:06:44,610 --> 00:06:47,110
Maybe he doesn't WANT
them to change.

96
00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:50,030
That's just thinking
of himself.

97
00:07:07,050 --> 00:07:08,300
Well, well.

98
00:07:08,380 --> 00:07:10,090
Hi, Leyte. Makken.

99
00:07:10,840 --> 00:07:12,010
Simon?

100
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:16,890
So, I guess she didn't
come here, either.

101
00:07:17,140 --> 00:07:19,720
I'm sorry we couldn't
be of more help.

102
00:07:20,100 --> 00:07:24,190
That's okay, I just came on
the off chance she was here.

103
00:07:26,070 --> 00:07:28,400
Simon, is everything okay?

104
00:07:31,740 --> 00:07:33,320
They saw the broadcast on TV?

105
00:07:34,370 --> 00:07:36,410
Nia's transmission.

106
00:07:36,830 --> 00:07:38,200
Yeah.

107
00:07:40,620 --> 00:07:42,250
Don't you worry!

108
00:07:42,540 --> 00:07:45,500
No matter what happens,
we'll come up with something!

109
00:07:46,420 --> 00:07:49,000
I don't know what this Humanity
Annihilation System thing is,

110
00:07:49,130 --> 00:07:51,720
...but it's nothing
to worry about!

111
00:07:56,470 --> 00:07:59,510
YOU'RE the one we're worried about.

112
00:08:00,390 --> 00:08:02,430
He looks pretty depressed.

113
00:08:02,850 --> 00:08:06,480
Shame he's not a mecha...
THAT, we could fix.

114
00:08:25,580 --> 00:08:29,670
Nia, where are you?

115
00:08:30,380 --> 00:08:33,840
Was that really you, Nia?

116
00:08:50,110 --> 00:08:51,780
Nia!

117
00:08:59,530 --> 00:09:03,040
<font color=#FFC9B9>Gurren Lagann</font>

118
00:09:04,540 --> 00:09:08,040
<font color=#FFC9B9>Gurren Lagann</font>

119
00:09:10,250 --> 00:09:11,460
Where am I?

120
00:09:11,590 --> 00:09:14,010
It has been seven years
since your death.

121
00:09:14,260 --> 00:09:17,130
No, it wasn't YOU that died.

122
00:09:17,640 --> 00:09:21,140
Lordgenome's knowledge and
memories are preserved as data.

123
00:09:21,350 --> 00:09:23,720
We didn't go as far as reproducing
his personality, as well.

124
00:09:24,310 --> 00:09:27,980
So, you would dig up a coffin and
drag out the corpse inside, eh?

125
00:09:28,060 --> 00:09:30,060
You have an odd notion of fun.

126
00:09:30,150 --> 00:09:32,770
We had to because you died
without telling us anything.

127
00:09:32,980 --> 00:09:34,780
This time, you can't get away.

128
00:09:35,570 --> 00:09:41,490
Now, tell me. What are Spiral Power
and the Anti-Spiral?

129
00:09:41,950 --> 00:09:44,450
What do they have to do
with humanity?!

130
00:09:45,040 --> 00:09:47,410
I've been looking everywhere!
Where have you been?

131
00:09:48,250 --> 00:09:50,000
A place unknown to you.

132
00:09:51,670 --> 00:09:53,170
Because I have learned.

133
00:09:53,250 --> 00:09:54,960
L-Learned what?

134
00:09:55,050 --> 00:09:58,170
That you and I are
completely incompatible.

135
00:09:59,340 --> 00:10:03,640
The Spiral Nemesis will bring about
this universe's destruction.

136
00:10:03,850 --> 00:10:08,390
We Anti-Spirals exist to
prevent that event.

137
00:10:09,560 --> 00:10:14,270
D-Do you have a fever or something?
I understand you even less than usual.

138
00:10:14,570 --> 00:10:19,740
Simon, the Core Drill you carry
is the very symbol of the Spiral Nemesis.

139
00:10:20,200 --> 00:10:24,200
Its power, the power of the Spiral,
will destroy the universe.

140
00:10:24,580 --> 00:10:27,200
Spiral Power is the
power of evolution.

141
00:10:28,040 --> 00:10:32,750
Lifeforms that carry helical DNA,
galaxies that take spiral shape,

142
00:10:32,840 --> 00:10:37,300
...they are amplified to infinite levels by
Spiral Power, which magnifies everything.

143
00:10:37,760 --> 00:10:40,510
That is the underpinning
of this universe.

144
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:44,510
However, there arose a group
who feared that power.

145
00:10:44,970 --> 00:10:48,730
That group is the Anti-Spiral races.

146
00:10:49,270 --> 00:10:53,100
My original body, Lordgenome,
was once a Spiral Warrior...

147
00:10:53,400 --> 00:10:57,530
...who fought the Anti-Spirals
in order to protect the galaxy.

148
00:10:57,990 --> 00:10:59,650
Spiral Warrior?

149
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:03,530
Lazengann, the gigantic Teppelin,
even the Gunmen,

150
00:11:03,990 --> 00:11:07,200
...were originally weapons
to fight the Anti-Spirals.

151
00:11:07,370 --> 00:11:10,500
Wait, are you telling me
that Lagann was also a--

152
00:11:10,580 --> 00:11:11,830
Exactly.

153
00:11:12,540 --> 00:11:15,170
It was one of our most
powerful weapons.

154
00:11:16,340 --> 00:11:18,460
It's a Core machine that is
activated by Spiral Power,

155
00:11:18,550 --> 00:11:21,170
...one which can control whatever
mecha it combines with.

156
00:11:21,590 --> 00:11:23,470
Who would have imagined that something
sealed away underground...

157
00:11:23,550 --> 00:11:25,720
...would be discovered
by humans?

158
00:11:25,810 --> 00:11:27,510
The hand of fate at work again.

159
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:28,970
But why?

160
00:11:29,060 --> 00:11:32,560
If you were one of these Spiral Warriors,
why would you subjugate humanity?

161
00:11:32,650 --> 00:11:34,270
Why force us underground?

162
00:11:37,320 --> 00:11:39,110
We had lost.

163
00:11:39,780 --> 00:11:44,160
The Spiral races were left with no choice
but to flee to their various homeworlds.

164
00:11:44,280 --> 00:11:46,830
Earth is one such world.

165
00:11:47,280 --> 00:11:50,290
After the Anti-Spirals
conquered the galaxy,

166
00:11:50,580 --> 00:11:53,370
...they installed Spiral lifeform
annihilation devices...

167
00:11:53,460 --> 00:11:57,040
...on any world where they detected
a Spiral lifeform signature.

168
00:11:57,170 --> 00:12:00,420
When the above-ground lifeform
population exceeds a set limit,

169
00:12:00,760 --> 00:12:03,220
...the device detects this,
then activates.

170
00:12:03,590 --> 00:12:06,760
And that's why you drove
all humanity underground?

171
00:12:07,050 --> 00:12:11,470
Think what you will of me, but I was trying
to preserve humanity as a species.

172
00:12:11,640 --> 00:12:16,060
I did this by maintaining a bare
minimum population underground.

173
00:12:16,610 --> 00:12:18,940
Why didn't you just come out
and tell us this?!

174
00:12:19,070 --> 00:12:21,150
Why did you use force
to subjugate us?!

175
00:12:22,740 --> 00:12:24,740
It wouldn't have worked.

176
00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:29,410
Foolish lifeforms that are driven
by the Spiral instinct...

177
00:12:29,540 --> 00:12:31,410
...blindly strive to
reach the heavens.

178
00:12:31,750 --> 00:12:34,750
Words and reason alone are
insufficient to curb that drive.

179
00:12:35,040 --> 00:12:38,080
The only thing that can...
is fear.

180
00:12:39,210 --> 00:12:41,760
And even so, you rebelled
against me.

181
00:12:43,630 --> 00:12:47,390
Even as a thousand years of
boredom weighed down on me,

182
00:12:47,470 --> 00:12:53,430
...my will was strong enough to keep
the Spiral instinct bottled up.

183
00:12:54,560 --> 00:12:59,560
And yet, your rebellion broke
my control and made my blood boil.

184
00:13:00,400 --> 00:13:02,280
That is the terror of the
power of the Spiral.

185
00:13:02,360 --> 00:13:06,740
Not even Lordgenome was able
to curb his instinct to fight.

186
00:13:06,990 --> 00:13:09,160
That's crazy!
I won't accept that!

187
00:13:09,660 --> 00:13:12,620
How could my and my Bro's fight
be the result of that?

188
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:15,290
It has been seven years
since you came to the surface.

189
00:13:15,410 --> 00:13:20,000
How far has human civilization
advanced in a mere seven years?

190
00:13:20,130 --> 00:13:23,000
Don't you find the speed
somewhat suspicious?

191
00:13:23,090 --> 00:13:25,880
That is the potential
of Spiral lifeforms.

192
00:13:26,010 --> 00:13:31,180
Having passed one million, human numbers
and civilization will advance explosively.

193
00:13:31,260 --> 00:13:33,850
They will become a power that
will be a threat to our own.

194
00:13:33,930 --> 00:13:36,640
And so, we will destroy you
before that can happen.

195
00:13:37,020 --> 00:13:39,150
That's what the Humanity
Annihilation System is?

196
00:13:39,400 --> 00:13:40,650
That mecha earlier?

197
00:13:41,320 --> 00:13:44,480
No matter what comes, we have
Gurren Lagann! We'll beat them!

198
00:13:45,070 --> 00:13:47,400
So please!
Snap out of it, Nia!

199
00:13:50,160 --> 00:13:51,780
That isn't possible.

200
00:13:52,030 --> 00:13:54,830
I am the messenger
of the Anti-Spirals.

201
00:13:54,950 --> 00:13:58,330
A virtual lifeform that lay hidden
in helical genetic code,

202
00:13:58,420 --> 00:14:02,340
...awakened when the Spiral Lifeform
Annihilation System was activated.

203
00:14:02,670 --> 00:14:06,670
Please, Nia! I'm begging you!
Talk to me in words I can understand!

204
00:14:07,380 --> 00:14:09,880
You never talked using words
like that, remember?

205
00:14:10,340 --> 00:14:13,640
When you talked, it was rambling
and incomprehensible...

206
00:14:13,720 --> 00:14:16,100
But it was warm,
and sweet, and...

207
00:14:16,640 --> 00:14:19,350
Aw, I can't explain it, but
you know what I mean, right?

208
00:14:19,810 --> 00:14:22,560
You didn't used to be like this!

209
00:14:22,770 --> 00:14:24,730
What you see now is the real me.

210
00:14:25,400 --> 00:14:29,530
Please, Lordgenome, you have to tell me!
What is the Humanity Annihilation System?!

211
00:14:29,660 --> 00:14:32,780
What does it do to
annihilate humanity?

212
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:37,700
In three weeks' time, the moon will
leave its orbit and impact the Earth

213
00:14:39,870 --> 00:14:42,210
And that will be
the end of it.

214
00:14:52,680 --> 00:14:54,470
T-The moon?

215
00:14:55,810 --> 00:14:58,270
Word of this can't get out
to the populace!

216
00:14:58,680 --> 00:15:00,850
There'll be a huge panic
in seconds!

217
00:15:01,690 --> 00:15:06,980
Lordgenome, this is top secret.
Discuss it with no one but me.

218
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:10,610
Rossiu! This is where
you've been?!

219
00:15:11,070 --> 00:15:12,450
Don't enter
without permission!

220
00:15:12,570 --> 00:15:15,120
Dumbass! Who cares
about that?!

221
00:15:15,200 --> 00:15:17,040
The moon probe Gunmen
has been destroyed!

222
00:15:18,830 --> 00:15:22,170
That ain't the half of it!
Check out the TV! The TV!

223
00:15:24,080 --> 00:15:25,290
Why, that's--

224
00:15:25,420 --> 00:15:27,630
It's been running live on TV
for a few minutes now.

225
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:29,670
She says the moon
is gonna fall.

226
00:15:31,300 --> 00:15:32,260
Impossible...!

227
00:15:32,340 --> 00:15:34,930
The little princess said it
plain as day!

228
00:15:35,050 --> 00:15:38,430
It's hard to believe, but after what
happened to the moon probe, who knows?

229
00:15:38,520 --> 00:15:40,430
Can we believe her, Rossiu?

230
00:15:40,560 --> 00:15:43,730
We were driven underground
because of some war...

231
00:15:44,020 --> 00:15:45,560
...between the Spiral
and Anti-Spiral races.

232
00:15:46,150 --> 00:15:47,820
It's just like Lordgenome predicted.

233
00:15:48,110 --> 00:15:50,070
The moon will become
Hell's messenger.

234
00:15:50,320 --> 00:15:52,900
It's coming down
on top of us!

235
00:15:57,160 --> 00:16:00,700
I was too late... My worst fears
are coming true.

236
00:16:01,540 --> 00:16:02,460
What the hell is this?

237
00:16:02,540 --> 00:16:04,580
I've seen this guy
before somewhere.

238
00:16:05,330 --> 00:16:08,290
I'll explain later. Let's go
to the Defense Planning Room.

239
00:16:11,510 --> 00:16:16,010
It's ironic that the human whose genes
contained the Anti-Spiral factor...

240
00:16:16,140 --> 00:16:18,350
...would be born as
Lordgenome's daughter.

241
00:16:19,390 --> 00:16:23,980
However, now that is has activated
and I have become an Anti-Spiral,

242
00:16:24,060 --> 00:16:26,520
...I can never be made
human again.

243
00:16:34,490 --> 00:16:35,490
Nia!

244
00:16:35,820 --> 00:16:37,450
Nia, where are you going?!

245
00:16:38,330 --> 00:16:40,330
Nia!

246
00:16:59,720 --> 00:17:01,010
Hey! What's going on?!

247
00:17:01,100 --> 00:17:02,850
Mugann have appeared again.

248
00:17:03,100 --> 00:17:05,270
- Mugann?
- That machine from earlier.

249
00:17:05,350 --> 00:17:07,150
That type has been
codenamed Mugann.

250
00:17:07,230 --> 00:17:09,060
Move it, Gimmy, Darry!

251
00:17:22,120 --> 00:17:22,870
Commander!

252
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:26,120
Simon! If you attack it and aren't careful,
it'll cause another big explosion!

253
00:17:26,370 --> 00:17:27,460
We need a plan!

254
00:17:27,500 --> 00:17:29,380
I'll come up with something
while I'm fighting!

255
00:17:29,460 --> 00:17:30,880
This is what I was
talking about!

256
00:17:31,210 --> 00:17:34,710
Leeron, have you found an effective
means of attacking it?

257
00:17:35,050 --> 00:17:37,050
This is data we got from
Gimmy and Darry.

258
00:17:37,340 --> 00:17:41,550
It looks like a powerful energy field
is erected around the body.

259
00:17:41,970 --> 00:17:45,390
That energy barrier
neutralizes our attacks.

260
00:17:45,810 --> 00:17:48,810
Then we just need to hit it with
more power than it can handle!

261
00:17:48,940 --> 00:17:52,480
We can't do that.
You saw that huge explosion, right?

262
00:17:52,730 --> 00:17:55,400
A Mugann is essentially
comprised entirely of explosives.

263
00:17:56,280 --> 00:17:59,570
When the energy field goes down
and it stops functioning,

264
00:17:59,740 --> 00:18:03,080
...the entire body converts into
energy in a split second.

265
00:18:03,450 --> 00:18:06,290
Its molecular structure
is that unstable?

266
00:18:06,410 --> 00:18:09,330
That would make spatial transference
easier, don't you think?

267
00:18:10,130 --> 00:18:12,380
What the hell are those two
talking about?

268
00:18:12,710 --> 00:18:14,130
Don't look at me.

269
00:18:23,350 --> 00:18:24,930
Out of the way!

270
00:18:37,950 --> 00:18:39,030
Oops!

271
00:18:39,110 --> 00:18:41,200
Don't say "oops,"
you bastard!

272
00:18:41,410 --> 00:18:44,240
Don't you think you've
done enough damage?!

273
00:18:46,830 --> 00:18:50,330
Normal attacks aren't effective... When it's
destroyed, it goes up in a huge blast...

274
00:18:50,500 --> 00:18:51,620
What are we supposed
to do?!

275
00:18:51,710 --> 00:18:54,540
Quit that whining. Our first order of
business is to halt their advance!

276
00:18:56,920 --> 00:18:58,590
Simon!

277
00:19:01,340 --> 00:19:02,470
Simon, wait a minute!

278
00:19:02,550 --> 00:19:04,390
At least draw it out
of the city first!

279
00:19:04,600 --> 00:19:06,180
We can't wait!

280
00:19:15,650 --> 00:19:17,820
Gimmy! Darry!
Shoot down the fragments!

281
00:19:18,150 --> 00:19:18,990
All of them!

282
00:19:19,070 --> 00:19:20,740
- Roger that!
- Roger!

283
00:19:30,040 --> 00:19:31,830
One down, one to go!

284
00:19:35,960 --> 00:19:37,590
- Simon!
- Thanks!

285
00:19:55,690 --> 00:19:57,060
And that's how it's done.

286
00:19:57,150 --> 00:20:01,280
Now I get it! We just need to detonate
them before they get to the city!

287
00:20:01,400 --> 00:20:03,070
I knew Simon could do it!

288
00:20:03,200 --> 00:20:05,280
Assuming they only come
at us in pairs.

289
00:20:05,620 --> 00:20:06,570
What's wrong?

290
00:20:06,700 --> 00:20:10,370
If they appear in larger numbers,
that won't be a viable method.

291
00:20:11,330 --> 00:20:13,920
Besides... It'll have the opposite
effect on the populace.

292
00:20:17,340 --> 00:20:18,250
What's going on?

293
00:20:18,380 --> 00:20:22,050
Dumb bastard! Is trashing stuff
all you're good for?!

294
00:20:22,130 --> 00:20:24,430
It's all your fault!
Get away from us!

295
00:20:24,510 --> 00:20:26,720
The moon's gonna fall on us!
What were you thinking?!

296
00:20:26,800 --> 00:20:30,890
Go away! It's your fault
they're attacking us!

297
00:20:31,270 --> 00:20:32,600
I can't believe it...

298
00:20:32,850 --> 00:20:35,100
He should have listened...

299
00:20:36,230 --> 00:20:37,730
This is...

300
00:20:38,820 --> 00:20:41,400
This is what my fighting
has caused?

301
00:20:48,200 --> 00:20:51,740
Remain calm, everyone!
Please listen to your government!

302
00:20:52,160 --> 00:20:54,330
- Look, guns!
- They're gonna shoot us!

303
00:20:54,620 --> 00:20:56,670
No, you're wrong!
We have no intention of--

304
00:21:08,260 --> 00:21:10,260
Stop that.
No guns.

305
00:21:11,220 --> 00:21:14,770
- Are you trying to kill us?!
- Get them before they get us!

306
00:21:15,140 --> 00:21:16,810
Chief Advisor!
Are you all right?

307
00:21:17,350 --> 00:21:20,270
It's not serious.
I'm fine, Kinon.

308
00:21:22,440 --> 00:21:25,490
An injury is an injury.
You should get it treated.

309
00:21:25,990 --> 00:21:28,780
I certainly hope
that this doesn't spread.

310
00:21:31,370 --> 00:21:35,960
It will. Human impulses catch fire
and spread in the blink of an eye.

311
00:21:36,750 --> 00:21:39,290
Just like they did when we
defeated Lordgenome.

312
00:21:39,580 --> 00:21:42,960
But in this case, those impulses
are directed somewhere else.

313
00:21:44,260 --> 00:21:46,340
Chief Advisor Rossiu...

314
00:21:47,380 --> 00:21:49,800
Someone must be made
to take responsibility.

315
00:21:49,930 --> 00:21:52,310
That is how a government functions.

316
00:22:00,190 --> 00:22:01,980
The Anti-Spiral...

317
00:22:02,730 --> 00:22:05,150
Who in the world
are they?

318
00:22:08,280 --> 00:22:09,820
Nia...

319
00:22:18,750 --> 00:22:21,170
What's all the ruckus, Rossiu?

320
00:22:23,380 --> 00:22:25,340
Rossiu?

321
00:22:25,840 --> 00:22:31,050
Supreme Commander Simon.
I hereby place you under arrest.

322
00:22:31,090 --> 00:22:35,100
To Be Continued...

323
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:39,780
<font color=#FFFF00>Dakara kakko tsukenaide motto jibun wo shinjite
