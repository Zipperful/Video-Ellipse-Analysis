1
00:00:10,670 --> 00:00:15,510
Gurren Lagann

2
00:00:15,580 --> 00:00:18,110
<font color=#FFFF00>Kimi ha kikoeru?
</font>Can you hear it?

3
00:00:18,250 --> 00:00:26,250
<font color=#FFFF00>Boku no kono koe ga yami ni munashiku suikomareta
</font>This voice of mine was sucked emptily into darkness

4
00:00:26,600 --> 00:00:31,700
<font color=#FFFF00>Moshimo sekai ga imi wo motsu no nara
</font>If the world has meaning to it,

5
00:00:32,030 --> 00:00:36,570
<font color=#FFFF00>Konna kimochi mo muda de ha nai
</font>Then these kinds of feelings aren't futile

6
00:00:36,910 --> 00:00:42,610
<font color=#FFFF00>Akogare ni oshitsubusarete akirametetanda
</font>I was crushed by my longing and had given up

7
00:00:42,910 --> 00:00:47,870
<font color=#FFFF00>Hateshinai sora no iro mo shiranaide
</font>Without even knowing the color of the endless sky

8
00:00:48,280 --> 00:00:53,190
<font color=#FFFF00>Hashiridashita omoi ga ima demo
</font>I began to run, because my feelings, even now,

9
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:58,960
<font color=#FFFF00>Kono mune wo tashika ni tataiteru kara
</font>Are definitely beating against my heart

10
00:00:59,230 --> 00:01:04,030
<font color=#FFFF00>Kyou no boku ga sono saki ni tsudzuku
</font>The me of today will continue towards our destination

11
00:01:04,500 --> 00:01:10,060
<font color=#FFFF00>Bokura nari no asu wo kizuite yuku
</font>We'll amass our own tomorrows

12
00:01:10,410 --> 00:01:18,900
<font color=#FFFF00>Kotae ha sou itsumo koko ni aru
</font>The answer, yes, is always right here

13
00:01:32,250 --> 00:01:36,380
Their powerful enemy Viral returns, and
Thymilph of the Four Generals appears.

14
00:01:36,550 --> 00:01:38,300
Comrades gather together.

15
00:01:38,470 --> 00:01:40,590
Amidst this suddenly
intensifying battle,

16
00:01:40,680 --> 00:01:43,560
...Kamina and Simon learn of the
existence of the Spiral King.

17
00:01:43,810 --> 00:01:45,970
To confront this
as-yet unseen enemy,

18
00:01:46,060 --> 00:01:50,270
...Kamina resolves to capture the gigantic
land battleship Dai-Gunzan.

19
00:01:50,400 --> 00:01:52,940
Volcanoes belch fire and rip
the heavens and earth asunder.

20
00:01:53,270 --> 00:01:54,940
The stage is set
for the final showdown.

21
00:01:55,070 --> 00:01:59,400
And the man will learn
his destiny.

22
00:02:11,710 --> 00:02:13,090
Y-Yoko!

23
00:02:13,170 --> 00:02:14,960
Ah, so this is
where you went.

24
00:02:17,050 --> 00:02:18,970
I couldn't get to sleep.

25
00:02:19,090 --> 00:02:22,890
You're under a lot of pressure. After all,
you're the key to today's operation.

26
00:02:23,100 --> 00:02:24,720
Well, that's part of it...

27
00:02:30,270 --> 00:02:32,690
Yoko...
The thing is, I...

28
00:02:35,900 --> 00:02:39,950
Those are called volcanoes.
Those fire-breathing mountains.

29
00:02:40,030 --> 00:02:43,030
There's molten magma bubbling
away inside the Earth's crust,

30
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:45,370
...and it comes shooting out
from the center of the earth.

31
00:02:45,490 --> 00:02:47,120
Ron told me about them.

32
00:02:47,410 --> 00:02:49,120
They're just like Kamina, then.

33
00:02:49,960 --> 00:02:54,080
It burns underground until it can't be
contained anymore, and then it explodes.

34
00:02:54,170 --> 00:02:55,960
Sounds just like him,
don't you think?

35
00:02:56,960 --> 00:02:57,880
What?

36
00:02:57,920 --> 00:03:00,670
Kamina said exactly
the same thing.

37
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:02,760
"That's exactly like me!"
he said.

38
00:03:02,970 --> 00:03:05,640
Is that the old "male bond"
at work, or what?

39
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:07,680
No, not exactly.

40
00:03:08,980 --> 00:03:09,980
Here.

41
00:03:10,270 --> 00:03:12,270
This is hot, too,
so be careful.

42
00:03:12,350 --> 00:03:15,650
If you go into battle hungry, Lagann won't
be running at full power, either.

43
00:03:16,020 --> 00:03:17,730
Thanks.

44
00:03:21,990 --> 00:03:23,910
Say, Simon...

45
00:03:28,660 --> 00:03:30,830
It's nothing, forget it.

46
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,710
Good luck.

47
00:03:37,380 --> 00:03:39,050
Here, sorry to
keep you waiting.

48
00:03:41,590 --> 00:03:44,720
I knew you could do it, Leeron.
I don't think I'll be missing with this.

49
00:03:44,800 --> 00:03:49,350
It's rare for you to let someone
else do maintenance on your gun.

50
00:03:49,970 --> 00:03:52,310
Because failure isn't an option today.

51
00:03:52,390 --> 00:03:53,810
You understand, I see.

52
00:03:53,900 --> 00:03:57,150
Gurren Lagann is far more powerful
than Gurren on its own.

53
00:03:57,230 --> 00:03:58,480
It's defensive ability, too.

54
00:03:58,610 --> 00:04:01,780
If Kamina rushes in like he usually does,
there's no telling what will happen.

55
00:04:01,860 --> 00:04:05,320
He's not the sort of man who will stop now,
no matter what we say to him.

56
00:04:05,450 --> 00:04:07,030
I'll try to keep him safe.

57
00:04:07,160 --> 00:04:09,330
Honestly, that man
is such a pain.

58
00:04:10,870 --> 00:04:14,210
You're quite a pain in
the patootie, yourself.

59
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:23,380
Here.

60
00:04:24,590 --> 00:04:28,350
If you eat too much,
won't that slow you down?

61
00:04:31,560 --> 00:04:34,770
I need power.
Especially today.

62
00:04:35,690 --> 00:04:38,150
Yoko, watch my back.

63
00:04:39,020 --> 00:04:41,610
I'll crush anything that comes
at me from up ahead.

64
00:04:42,150 --> 00:04:44,530
So I need you to deal with
anything from behind.

65
00:04:45,910 --> 00:04:46,820
Kamina.

66
00:04:52,580 --> 00:04:55,580
Your back is one big
blind spot, isn't it?

67
00:04:56,920 --> 00:04:58,630
What are you--

68
00:05:13,430 --> 00:05:14,680
I'll pay that back ten times over.

69
00:05:16,020 --> 00:05:18,190
When we get back,
I'll repay that ten times over.

70
00:05:18,270 --> 00:05:19,650
Mark my words.

71
00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:24,480
What's with you?

72
00:05:24,990 --> 00:05:27,700
Don't you think you could phrase
that a little more romantically?

73
00:05:29,240 --> 00:05:32,660
Now, let's head out there
and raise a little hell!

74
00:05:33,410 --> 00:05:37,080
Kamina. I'm looking forward
to being repaid.

75
00:05:37,460 --> 00:05:38,580
Sure!

76
00:05:57,560 --> 00:05:58,890
What the hell?

77
00:05:58,980 --> 00:06:00,520
Must be a case of nerves.

78
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:09,030
It's none of my business!
It's none of my business!

79
00:06:09,240 --> 00:06:11,070
It's none of my business!
It's none of my business!

80
00:06:11,410 --> 00:06:13,450
It's none of my business!
It's none of my business!

81
00:06:13,830 --> 00:06:16,450
It's none of my business!
It's none of my business!

82
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:20,040
What she does is none
of my damn business!

83
00:06:25,920 --> 00:06:27,460
W-What's wrong?!

84
00:06:27,550 --> 00:06:29,800
Uh, it's nothing.

85
00:06:30,090 --> 00:06:32,140
It's only natural
at a time like this.

86
00:06:32,220 --> 00:06:34,510
Don't worry about it.
I know you can do this.

87
00:06:34,640 --> 00:06:35,930
S-Sure...

88
00:06:36,060 --> 00:06:38,560
Let's get out there,
blood brother!

89
00:06:40,770 --> 00:06:43,310
All right, listen up!
This plan is straightforward!

90
00:06:43,400 --> 00:06:47,780
First off, we Gunmen pilots will attack
to draw out the enemy's Gunmen.

91
00:06:48,150 --> 00:06:50,200
In the meantime, Simon will
use Lagann to combine...

92
00:06:50,320 --> 00:06:53,240
...with that behemoth's head
to take control of it from them!

93
00:06:53,740 --> 00:06:56,700
Then, we'll use the captured behemoth
to crush the enemy Gunmen!

94
00:06:56,830 --> 00:06:59,700
At that point, the fight is ours!
Are we clear?!

95
00:06:59,790 --> 00:07:00,960
Yeah!

96
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:03,420
We get it! We hit 'em,
and hit 'em hard!

97
00:07:03,960 --> 00:07:07,050
I made arrangements for the Gunmen pilots
to be able to speak to one another.

98
00:07:07,130 --> 00:07:11,260
Of course, I don't think they're the
sort who listen to what they're told,

99
00:07:11,340 --> 00:07:14,590
...but if you want to live, I suggest
that you remain in contact.

100
00:07:14,890 --> 00:07:16,390
Um... Yeah!

101
00:07:16,470 --> 00:07:19,140
We make contact!
Then we smash!

102
00:07:19,230 --> 00:07:21,350
All right, you bozos!
Let's get to it!

103
00:07:21,480 --> 00:07:23,850
Team Dai-Gurren, move out!

104
00:07:23,940 --> 00:07:26,270
Yeah!

105
00:07:29,400 --> 00:07:31,740
You guys are in charge of
keeping this place safe!

106
00:07:31,820 --> 00:07:33,610
Leave it to us, big brother!

107
00:07:33,740 --> 00:07:35,280
You can do it!

108
00:07:38,450 --> 00:07:39,540
Thanks for the lift.

109
00:07:39,660 --> 00:07:42,040
It's always an honor to
have a lady on board.

110
00:07:42,170 --> 00:07:44,040
Yoko, no fair!

111
00:07:46,170 --> 00:07:48,040
Simon, good luck!

112
00:07:48,340 --> 00:07:49,960
Good luck.

113
00:07:53,550 --> 00:07:55,510
Isn't this awesome, Simon?

114
00:07:56,180 --> 00:07:59,140
When we left the village,
Team Gurren was just us two.

115
00:07:59,270 --> 00:08:03,060
And now, we're heading out to pick a fight
with the Beastmen with all these buddies.

116
00:08:03,560 --> 00:08:05,400
This is so damn awesome...

117
00:08:06,610 --> 00:08:08,230
Boota says he was there, too.

118
00:08:09,400 --> 00:08:12,400
Hey, you're right. I forgot.
Sorry about that.

119
00:08:12,700 --> 00:08:15,070
Team Gurren was two guys
and one pig-mole.

120
00:08:15,490 --> 00:08:17,320
I was there, too,
if you recall.

121
00:08:17,870 --> 00:08:21,290
When you left your village,
I was there, too.

122
00:08:21,370 --> 00:08:22,290
Oh, you were?

123
00:08:22,370 --> 00:08:23,660
You don't remember?

124
00:08:23,790 --> 00:08:28,040
Well, either way, you weren't in
Team Gurren back then, Yoko.

125
00:08:28,170 --> 00:08:29,750
How can you say that?

126
00:08:31,380 --> 00:08:33,300
We can hear every word, Yoko!

127
00:08:34,260 --> 00:08:37,890
All comm channels are open.
I just explained, remember?

128
00:08:37,970 --> 00:08:42,270
If we're this relaxed, we'll do fine.
We can win this fight, right, Kamina?

129
00:08:42,930 --> 00:08:47,020
Of course we can!
Who the hell do you think I am?!

130
00:08:47,270 --> 00:08:51,480
Keep everything else out of your mind.
Concentrate, Simon!

131
00:09:02,500 --> 00:09:06,000
<font color=#FFC9B9>Gurren Lagann</font>

132
00:09:07,500 --> 00:09:11,000
<font color=#FFC9B9>Gurren Lagann</font>

133
00:09:11,380 --> 00:09:13,510
It's in your hands now, everyone.

134
00:09:14,130 --> 00:09:15,130
What are those?

135
00:09:15,220 --> 00:09:19,010
One is connected to Lagann's systems,
and the other to Gurren's.

136
00:09:19,350 --> 00:09:20,430
Care to help?

137
00:09:20,510 --> 00:09:21,180
Sure.

138
00:09:21,260 --> 00:09:22,430
Me, too! Me, too!

139
00:09:22,520 --> 00:09:26,520
Now, now! If you touch that,
I'm gonna gobble you up!

140
00:09:35,320 --> 00:09:36,320
Okay!

141
00:09:41,580 --> 00:09:43,950
- Let's do it!
- Yeah!

142
00:09:45,830 --> 00:09:47,460
We've been waiting!

143
00:09:47,790 --> 00:09:50,130
We knew that you would
try to sneak up on us!

144
00:09:50,460 --> 00:09:52,380
We were counting on it!

145
00:09:56,340 --> 00:09:57,380
Boulders?

146
00:09:57,510 --> 00:09:59,010
Suck rocks, furballs!

147
00:09:59,090 --> 00:10:03,430
Damn! Barbaric humans!
Can't you meet us fist to fist?

148
00:10:03,560 --> 00:10:05,720
This rock IS my fist!

149
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:10,150
A rock is a rock!
It's not a fist!

150
00:10:10,400 --> 00:10:14,440
Stating the obvious is your idea
of a defiant speech? Dumbass!

151
00:10:14,820 --> 00:10:16,320
You dare mock me?!

152
00:10:16,400 --> 00:10:18,320
Just a moment, Viral.

153
00:10:18,450 --> 00:10:23,910
It's unbecoming to get riled up over
every foolish thing these humans say.

154
00:10:23,990 --> 00:10:28,620
Such paltry attacks won't so much
as dent Dai-Gunzan!

155
00:10:32,460 --> 00:10:33,840
Laugh THIS off!

156
00:10:36,510 --> 00:10:38,510
How dare you stinking humans!

157
00:10:38,550 --> 00:10:42,430
Dai-Gunzan, activate!
Open all gun ports!

158
00:10:42,510 --> 00:10:44,470
Send them flying!

159
00:10:49,980 --> 00:10:54,940
Catapult Arm, stand by!

160
00:10:55,070 --> 00:10:56,650
Throw!

161
00:11:06,200 --> 00:11:07,580
Not a chance!

162
00:11:17,840 --> 00:11:21,510
Kamina! This time, I'm getting
my helmet back!

163
00:11:21,630 --> 00:11:24,510
You're STILL whining about that?
I never pegged you for the stingy type.

164
00:11:25,470 --> 00:11:26,470
Its face is missing!

165
00:11:26,680 --> 00:11:28,600
Damn you, where is your head?!

166
00:11:29,230 --> 00:11:31,850
Now!
Get going, Simon!

167
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:39,610
Enemy detected overhead!
Twelve o'clock high!

168
00:11:39,940 --> 00:11:41,360
Shoot him down!

169
00:11:41,400 --> 00:11:44,450
There's a blind spot overhead. Our flak
curtain doesn't completely cover us.

170
00:11:44,700 --> 00:11:46,200
Try to do something
using fighting spirit!

171
00:11:46,530 --> 00:11:50,500
We have the edge in spirit, too!
Get in there, Simon!

172
00:11:50,620 --> 00:11:52,910
Lagann Impact!

173
00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:55,790
That was close!

174
00:11:55,880 --> 00:11:58,460
General Thymilph,
you're in danger here!

175
00:12:01,300 --> 00:12:03,130
What are you trying to do?!

176
00:12:03,300 --> 00:12:07,430
We merged 'em! We merged our
Lagann with your Dai-Gunzan!

177
00:12:07,930 --> 00:12:08,930
You've what?!

178
00:12:09,140 --> 00:12:11,310
That behemoth is now ours!

179
00:12:11,480 --> 00:12:13,850
Damn you, Kamina,
you set us up!

180
00:12:16,150 --> 00:12:18,480
Yeah, that I did!

181
00:12:20,570 --> 00:12:24,450
I put our luck and our
mettle to the test!

182
00:12:27,740 --> 00:12:30,910
How did he get so good
so quickly?!

183
00:12:40,960 --> 00:12:42,630
Nice shooting, Yoko!

184
00:12:42,760 --> 00:12:46,260
I gave you my word! I've got your back,
so you can fight Viral without worrying.

185
00:12:46,510 --> 00:12:48,970
I'm gonna run!
Hold on!

186
00:12:54,600 --> 00:12:58,020
Those two are good!
I'm not gonna let 'em win, either!

187
00:13:04,610 --> 00:13:06,610
Hey! What's the
big idea, Simon?

188
00:13:06,950 --> 00:13:11,240
Sorry, it wasn't on purpose!
I can't control it very well, that's all!

189
00:13:11,330 --> 00:13:13,790
Sounds like the combining
isn't going smoothly.

190
00:13:13,870 --> 00:13:16,620
He can't completely synch up with
the enemy's control systems.

191
00:13:16,750 --> 00:13:19,460
I wonder if he's worried
about something?

192
00:13:19,750 --> 00:13:24,460
Lagann's power is tied in to
Simon's mental state, right?

193
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:26,800
Can't you regain control?

194
00:13:26,970 --> 00:13:30,090
I'm sorry, sir.
It's still unresponsive.

195
00:13:30,180 --> 00:13:32,430
This must be the work of that
Gunmen that's only a face.

196
00:13:32,930 --> 00:13:36,640
Are they seriously trying to
take over my Dai-Gunzan?

197
00:13:36,730 --> 00:13:41,400
I'll go tear him loose myself!
In my Byakou!

198
00:13:41,690 --> 00:13:43,320
What's the matter, Simon?
What's the holdup?

199
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:45,690
I'm trying! I'm trying,
but it's not working!

200
00:13:47,280 --> 00:13:51,120
Why?! Why is that keeping me
from concentrating?! Damn it!

201
00:13:53,410 --> 00:13:55,290
You blew it during
your endgame, Kamina.

202
00:13:55,370 --> 00:13:58,830
Ignore the small fry! Everyone return
to Dai-Gunzan at once!

203
00:14:01,340 --> 00:14:03,090
You're not going anywhere!

204
00:14:03,340 --> 00:14:07,090
You guys keep the Gunmen pinned down!
I'll see what I can do about Simon!

205
00:14:07,170 --> 00:14:08,220
Yeah!

206
00:14:21,480 --> 00:14:23,110
Open the hatch, Simon!

207
00:14:24,610 --> 00:14:26,610
Let's see you grit those teeth!

208
00:14:33,580 --> 00:14:34,620
Bro?

209
00:14:36,910 --> 00:14:38,660
Have you snapped out of it?

210
00:14:39,830 --> 00:14:42,960
If you ever start to doubt yourself,
I'll always come to belt you one.

211
00:14:43,460 --> 00:14:47,130
So don't worry,
I'm here at your side.

212
00:14:47,380 --> 00:14:48,840
Believe in yourself.

213
00:14:49,260 --> 00:14:52,180
Believe in the Simon
that I have faith in.

214
00:14:56,930 --> 00:14:58,100
You got it!

215
00:15:03,900 --> 00:15:04,860
Amazing!

216
00:15:04,940 --> 00:15:07,280
You're doing well, Simon!
Very well, indeed!

217
00:15:07,570 --> 00:15:10,740
You're synchronizing steadily!
Just a little more!

218
00:15:18,910 --> 00:15:21,160
See, you can do it if you--

219
00:15:35,800 --> 00:15:36,890
Bro?

220
00:15:36,970 --> 00:15:38,220
Kamina?!

221
00:15:41,850 --> 00:15:47,820
I won't hand over
my Dai-Gunzan so easily!

222
00:15:48,150 --> 00:15:49,860
Thymilph?!
Damn, I didn't--

223
00:15:54,910 --> 00:15:57,700
You forgot this.
You can have it back.

224
00:15:57,830 --> 00:15:59,160
You son of a...

225
00:15:59,330 --> 00:16:01,540
Alkaid Glaive!

226
00:16:04,580 --> 00:16:06,500
You're a tenacious man,
I'll give you that.

227
00:16:06,630 --> 00:16:10,050
But this is the end
of the line for you!

228
00:16:27,730 --> 00:16:29,520
It can't be...

229
00:16:42,370 --> 00:16:43,620
I don't believe it...

230
00:16:48,540 --> 00:16:52,300
Bro!

231
00:17:25,540 --> 00:17:27,790
What's happened?!

232
00:17:27,880 --> 00:17:29,250
General Thymilph, look out!

233
00:17:31,960 --> 00:17:33,670
Viral!

234
00:17:34,420 --> 00:17:36,420
What the hell happened?!

235
00:17:36,510 --> 00:17:38,260
Dai-Gunzan has gone berserk!

236
00:17:39,010 --> 00:17:41,510
If it stays on course, it'll fall into
the mouth of the volcano!

237
00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:44,390
Pull yourself together, Simon!
Do you read me?!

238
00:17:46,060 --> 00:17:48,770
Can't a guy get a little sleep
around here?

239
00:17:55,110 --> 00:17:57,280
Simon, stop!
Simon!

240
00:17:58,160 --> 00:17:59,410
It's no use...

241
00:17:59,700 --> 00:18:04,160
I can't do anything...
There's nothing I can do now.

242
00:18:06,620 --> 00:18:10,120
Simon! Let's see you
grit those teeth!

243
00:18:20,180 --> 00:18:22,050
Bro? You're alive!

244
00:18:22,930 --> 00:18:26,930
Simon, who the hell do
you think you are?

245
00:18:29,060 --> 00:18:32,480
Your drill is the drill that's gonna
bore through heaven and earth,

246
00:18:32,610 --> 00:18:34,400
...and even tomorrow!

247
00:18:34,570 --> 00:18:38,570
What're you sitting here dawdling for?
We've won, kid!

248
00:18:38,650 --> 00:18:40,990
That behemoth belongs
to you now.

249
00:18:41,070 --> 00:18:43,620
You don't have to worry
about anything now.

250
00:18:45,330 --> 00:18:48,000
Bro... You're right!

251
00:18:56,960 --> 00:19:00,930
Everybody! Everything's okay now!
Dai-Gunzan is ours!

252
00:19:01,220 --> 00:19:02,300
Come on aboard!

253
00:19:05,600 --> 00:19:07,520
You damn dirty humans...

254
00:19:07,600 --> 00:19:10,940
I received that as a gift from
the Spiral King himself!

255
00:19:11,190 --> 00:19:14,980
I'd sooner destroy it than see it
fall into your hands!

256
00:19:16,900 --> 00:19:20,150
That old furball doesn't know
when to give up, does he?

257
00:19:20,240 --> 00:19:23,610
Come on, Simon.
Let's send these clowns packing.

258
00:19:24,830 --> 00:19:29,910
Combine. We'll use Gurren Lagann
to do this last mission!

259
00:19:30,120 --> 00:19:31,790
You got it, Bro!

260
00:19:39,840 --> 00:19:41,170
Let's do it!

261
00:19:50,810 --> 00:19:55,900
We brawlers are sustained by willpower
even when mocked as crazy and reckless!

262
00:19:56,610 --> 00:19:59,280
If there's a wall in our way,
we smash it down!

263
00:19:59,400 --> 00:20:01,900
If there isn't a path,
we carve one out ourselves!

264
00:20:03,160 --> 00:20:05,780
The magma of our souls
burns with a mighty flame!

265
00:20:06,280 --> 00:20:09,370
Super Ultra Combining,
Gurren Lagann!

266
00:20:09,620 --> 00:20:10,330
Who...

267
00:20:10,370 --> 00:20:11,410
...the hell...

268
00:20:11,620 --> 00:20:14,370
--do you think we are?!

269
00:20:20,800 --> 00:20:22,840
There's nobody else like them.

270
00:20:23,130 --> 00:20:26,260
Stand your ground!
Kill them! Kill them!

271
00:20:26,680 --> 00:20:28,890
Make tracks, cannon fodder!

272
00:20:43,490 --> 00:20:46,860
Damn you...
Condemn Blaze!

273
00:20:47,280 --> 00:20:49,780
You'll have to do better
than that!

274
00:20:52,700 --> 00:20:54,210
I-Impossible!

275
00:20:54,750 --> 00:20:57,500
Listen close, Simon.
Never forget.

276
00:20:57,580 --> 00:20:59,290
Believe in yourself.

277
00:20:59,420 --> 00:21:04,260
Not in the Simon that I believe in.
Not in the Kamina that you believe in.

278
00:21:04,340 --> 00:21:07,930
Have faith in the Simon
that believes in you.

279
00:21:08,050 --> 00:21:09,680
Bro?

280
00:21:11,560 --> 00:21:15,020
Finishing move!

281
00:21:23,690 --> 00:21:32,160
Giga Drill Break!

282
00:21:53,930 --> 00:21:56,810
Later, buddy...

283
00:21:58,730 --> 00:22:00,730
Bro?

284
00:22:02,110 --> 00:22:03,860
Bro?

285
00:22:25,130 --> 00:22:29,880
That day, we lost something
that could never be replaced.

286
00:22:30,340 --> 00:22:35,100
<font color=#000000>Episode 8:

<font color=#FFFF00>Kemono no you na koe de sakebitsudzuketa

298

<b>Next Time</b>

299
00:24:06,820 --> 00:24:10,860
Dark, sunken eyes.
Feelings that can't be suppressed.

300
00:24:11,150 --> 00:24:14,070
This wetness striking my cheek,
is this "rain"?

301
00:24:14,910 --> 00:24:20,620
Next time on Gurren Lagann,
"What, Exactly, Is A Human?"

302
00:24:15,990 --> 00:24:20,620
<b>What, Exactly, Is A Human?</b>
