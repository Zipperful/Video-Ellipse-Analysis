7
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:48,040
<font color=#FFFF00>Sagashite ita boku dake ni dekiru koto
</font>It's something only I, who sought you, can do

8
00:00:48,100 --> 00:00:53,110
<font color=#FFFF00>Ano hi kureta kotoba ga ima demo
</font>Those words you gave me that day, even now,

10
00:00:59,050 --> 00:01:04,210

</font>The answer, yes, is always right here

13
00:01:31,500 --> 00:01:35,590
This is the tale of a man who blows
a hole in the fate of a universe...

14
00:01:35,670 --> 00:01:38,380
...that is ruled by the endless
cycle of violence.

15
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:41,640
As the Earth's destruction
looms ever closer,

16
00:01:41,720 --> 00:01:44,890
...the reborn Gurren Lagann
combines with the Arc-Gurren,

17
00:01:45,350 --> 00:01:50,480
...and, with the moon Gunmen now under
his control, Simon saves the Earth.

18
00:01:50,610 --> 00:01:54,230
However, Nia, the
Anti-Spiral's messenger,

19
00:01:54,360 --> 00:01:57,400
...is recalled to the
enemy homeworld.

20
00:02:17,880 --> 00:02:23,640
<b>Episode 23:

00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:28,140
<b>One Week Since Prevention of Moonfall</b>

22
00:02:27,020 --> 00:02:30,230
This is Viral, who has been made Gurren's main pilot.

<b>Arc-Gurren Council Chamber</b>

24
00:02:30,690 --> 00:02:33,520
I'm going to have him attend our mission
planning sessions from now on.

25
00:02:34,070 --> 00:02:37,320
I don't expect you to simply
let bygones be bygones.

26
00:02:37,490 --> 00:02:40,990
But I DO want you to understand
that it isn't just humans...

27
00:02:41,070 --> 00:02:43,490
...who want to protect
the Earth.

28
00:02:44,030 --> 00:02:47,700
Well, well! Listen to you,
bein' all modest!

29
00:02:49,080 --> 00:02:52,540
You don't have to beg and scrape.
You were hand-picked by Simon.

30
00:02:52,670 --> 00:02:54,670
That makes you the same
as the rest of us.

31
00:02:55,170 --> 00:02:58,630
We're about to launch a frontal assault
on the enemy's stronghold.

32
00:02:58,720 --> 00:03:01,630
We can't waste time worrying
about the little things.

33
00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:04,600
And there are some of us who
haven't changed one bit...

34
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:06,600
...after showing up again
after six years.

35
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:08,810
Goodness, whoever do you mean?

36
00:03:08,890 --> 00:03:11,440
I thought you said we weren't
sweating the details.

37
00:03:11,730 --> 00:03:15,310
Yeah! Nobody's better than humans
at being rough and ready!

38
00:03:18,190 --> 00:03:19,610
You humans are...

39
00:03:19,900 --> 00:03:22,860
That reminds me,
has anyone seen Rossiu?

40
00:03:26,120 --> 00:03:27,580
Huh?

41
00:03:27,740 --> 00:03:29,870
Hey, Rossiu, where
are you headed?

42
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:33,170
Aretenborough, don't be in
such a rush all the time.

43
00:03:35,710 --> 00:03:38,340
He's hammering out the
Surface Restoration Plan.

44
00:03:38,800 --> 00:03:41,630
He said he'll leave all further
mission planning up to us.

45
00:03:44,680 --> 00:03:47,100
All right, let's get down
to business.

46
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:49,850
This is the result of collating
all data thus far.

47
00:03:50,350 --> 00:03:54,520
The Earth Spiral race flagship currently
in lunar orbit, the Cathedral Terra.

48
00:03:54,730 --> 00:03:58,320
It was stolen by the Anti-Spiral
and disguised as our moon.

49
00:03:58,780 --> 00:04:01,820
Gurren Lagann. Arc-Gurren.
Cathedral Terra.

50
00:04:02,650 --> 00:04:06,110
The thing that brings out the potential
of each is Spiral Power.

51
00:04:06,200 --> 00:04:09,240
That refers to the power of evolution
present in us lifeforms...

52
00:04:09,330 --> 00:04:12,200
...that possess a double-helix
genetic structure.

53
00:04:15,540 --> 00:04:18,340
To put it in simple terms,
it's fighting spirit.

54
00:04:18,460 --> 00:04:21,420
- Oh, that!
- Makes perfect sense!

55
00:04:21,800 --> 00:04:26,800
It appears that the Anti-Spiral were
originally Spiral lifeforms just like us.

56
00:04:27,180 --> 00:04:30,470
However, they believed that
continued use of this power...

57
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:33,600
...would lead to the destruction
of the universe.

58
00:04:33,980 --> 00:04:37,900
The Spiral Nemesis will bring about
this universe's destruction.

59
00:04:38,310 --> 00:04:42,480
We Anti-Spiral exist
to prevent that event.

60
00:04:42,610 --> 00:04:46,910
By "Spiral Nemesis," she probably
means the destruction of the universe.

61
00:04:47,370 --> 00:04:52,830
Anyway, the Spirals failed to put down the
Anti-Spiral rebellion and were defeated.

62
00:04:54,620 --> 00:04:56,000
Why did that happen,
you ask?

63
00:04:56,580 --> 00:04:58,710
It was because they hid their
stronghold somewhere...

64
00:04:58,840 --> 00:05:01,500
...in a universe with a different
set of dimensional axes.

65
00:05:02,380 --> 00:05:06,170
Having emerged victorious, the Anti-Spiral
built Spiral lifeform annihilation systems...

66
00:05:06,340 --> 00:05:09,220
...on each Spiral race's homeworld.

67
00:05:10,050 --> 00:05:15,060
To survive, the Spiral races were forced to
eke out a meager existence underground.

68
00:05:16,350 --> 00:05:19,020
What's the story with
the Beastmen, then?

69
00:05:19,110 --> 00:05:20,810
Or all the animals
on the surface?

70
00:05:20,900 --> 00:05:24,150
We're all beings that were
created by the Spiral King.

71
00:05:24,570 --> 00:05:26,900
Our reproduction is done
entirely through cloning.

72
00:05:27,240 --> 00:05:28,530
What does that mean?

73
00:05:28,570 --> 00:05:32,580
They don't have Spiral Power,
so they can't have children.

74
00:05:33,450 --> 00:05:37,750
It's the genetic diversity resulting from
gamogenesis that is the key to evolution.

75
00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:41,500
It's in this that the upwardly-mobile
Power of the Spiral resides.

76
00:05:44,170 --> 00:05:46,970
In other words, it means that
love changes the universe!

77
00:05:48,090 --> 00:05:49,760
<b>At the same time...</b>

78
00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:51,600

And that's also where
we'll find Nia, right?

85
00:06:02,520 --> 00:06:03,980
Y-Yeah, I guess...

86
00:06:04,070 --> 00:06:05,860
Come on, don't be embarrassed.

87
00:06:06,030 --> 00:06:07,860
Love changes the universe, remember?

88
00:06:08,360 --> 00:06:11,160
So I say let's change it.
We'll force it to.

89
00:06:11,570 --> 00:06:15,580
Yeah! Love and spirit!
Let's do this!

90
00:06:15,700 --> 00:06:17,830
It doesn't sound as good
coming from you.

91
00:06:17,960 --> 00:06:19,410
Kiss my ass.

92
00:06:19,790 --> 00:06:23,290
I think I understand where your
strength comes from now.

93
00:06:23,340 --> 00:06:26,170
We're just getting started. We'll get
a lot stronger before we're done.

94
00:06:26,210 --> 00:06:27,460
So you can win?

95
00:06:27,510 --> 00:06:29,840
Sort of.
But not just for that.

96
00:06:42,060 --> 00:06:43,940
Who's there?

97
00:06:49,200 --> 00:06:50,950
Father Magin!

98
00:06:51,030 --> 00:06:53,570
Rossiu?

99
00:06:57,540 --> 00:06:58,870
What's the matter, Kinon?

100
00:06:59,040 --> 00:07:00,290
Simon...

101
00:07:00,620 --> 00:07:05,040
Rossiu sent me an e-mail with
the Surface Restoration Plan.

102
00:07:05,290 --> 00:07:07,630
That's Rossiu for you.
He finished it already?

103
00:07:07,710 --> 00:07:11,510
The thing is, there was a message
to me written on the last page.

104
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:18,850
So, what are you doing
all the way out here?

105
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:21,640
I could ask the same
of you, Father Magin.

106
00:07:22,690 --> 00:07:24,690
It's the strangest thing.

107
00:07:24,770 --> 00:07:27,690
This place is hardly full
of happy memories for me,

108
00:07:27,780 --> 00:07:30,990
...and yet, it seems to be
the anchor of my soul.

109
00:07:32,740 --> 00:07:35,530
It must have been hard for you.

110
00:07:37,740 --> 00:07:39,330
No, sir.

111
00:07:40,750 --> 00:07:41,580
Here.

112
00:07:41,660 --> 00:07:44,330
Why, that's--
It's our holy book!

113
00:07:46,670 --> 00:07:48,840
You kept it all this time?

114
00:07:49,340 --> 00:07:53,550
I'm returning it to you.
I'm not the right man to hold it.

115
00:07:53,630 --> 00:07:55,470
Have you read it?

116
00:07:55,760 --> 00:07:58,600
No. That book can't be read.

117
00:07:59,020 --> 00:08:02,560
I compared the writing to every
known form of ancient writing,

118
00:08:02,690 --> 00:08:04,940
But there was no such
writing anywhere.

119
00:08:05,020 --> 00:08:06,230
What is it, then?

120
00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:09,320
Someone probably made it
as a practical joke.

121
00:08:09,940 --> 00:08:13,570
A joke? Our holy book
was just nonsense?

122
00:08:16,030 --> 00:08:17,410
Yes.

123
00:08:26,290 --> 00:08:31,210
So, I was preaching God's word with
someone's practical joke in my hand?

124
00:08:31,300 --> 00:08:32,630
That's rich!

125
00:08:33,840 --> 00:08:37,930
You learn that something you thought was
a precious treasure was nothing but junk.

126
00:08:38,140 --> 00:08:40,390
I wonder if that qualifies
as evolution, too?

127
00:08:40,600 --> 00:08:44,600
Yes, it's possible.
What a strange thing.

128
00:08:46,020 --> 00:08:51,150
But you know, Rossiu, that's exactly
what makes humans so fascinating.

129
00:08:51,860 --> 00:08:54,150
Don't you think so, too?

130
00:08:55,660 --> 00:09:00,240
No, I don't. I don't see it
that way at all.

131
00:09:05,620 --> 00:09:07,830
Aretenborough says that
he saw Rossiu.

132
00:09:08,330 --> 00:09:11,000
He said he flew off somewhere
in a Gun-spinner.

133
00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:15,220
Never think that you
can go it alone.

134
00:09:15,300 --> 00:09:17,930
I want you to get the job done
with the people around you.

135
00:09:18,010 --> 00:09:21,810
I know you can do it.
That is all I can tell you.

136
00:09:22,470 --> 00:09:24,720
Thank you for everything.

137
00:09:25,270 --> 00:09:28,810
Kinon, I am grateful
for your friendship.

138
00:09:30,440 --> 00:09:32,650
He's been acting funny
for a long time.

139
00:09:32,780 --> 00:09:36,740
Ever since we returned to the surface.
Like he was haunted by something.

140
00:09:36,820 --> 00:09:38,200
Stay calm, Kinon.

141
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:40,740
Do you think you can track
his Gun-spinner's signature?

142
00:09:41,620 --> 00:09:43,080
Huh? Oh. Yes!

143
00:09:44,830 --> 00:09:47,910
It's faint, but I'm getting something
to the east-northeast.

144
00:09:48,500 --> 00:09:49,710
Roger.

145
00:09:52,300 --> 00:09:54,050
Hey, where are you going?

146
00:09:54,380 --> 00:09:56,970
The ground was distorted by
the approach of the moon.

147
00:09:57,510 --> 00:10:00,760
I don't want my hometown to be destroyed,
so I'll go check it over.

148
00:10:01,010 --> 00:10:03,220
- Then allow me to--
- No.

149
00:10:03,680 --> 00:10:06,640
It's dangerous, so please
wait up here.

150
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:08,770
Rossiu!

151
00:10:08,890 --> 00:10:11,480
I think you did a fine job.

152
00:10:14,980 --> 00:10:19,900
You did a fine job. Not everyone
could have done what you did.

153
00:10:32,840 --> 00:10:34,290
The reading is close!

154
00:10:34,550 --> 00:10:36,340
That's it?

155
00:10:38,130 --> 00:10:41,010
Come in, pilot!
State your destination!

156
00:10:41,180 --> 00:10:42,930
Is that you, Commander?

157
00:10:43,010 --> 00:10:46,470
We're returning the animals
to their habitats.

158
00:10:49,100 --> 00:10:52,480
Sorry to bother you.
Continue doing your job.

159
00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:54,810
We were chasing the
wrong heat source...

160
00:10:55,150 --> 00:10:56,610
Don't panic, Kinon.

161
00:10:56,900 --> 00:11:01,700
Rossiu didn't... He didn't overthrow you
for personal gain.

162
00:11:02,200 --> 00:11:05,160
After the trial, I saw him--

163
00:11:20,510 --> 00:11:22,380
I know he didn't, Kinon.

164
00:11:22,470 --> 00:11:26,350
That's it! Simon, what about
the village where he was born?

165
00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:28,970
He used to talk about it
all the time!

166
00:11:29,020 --> 00:11:32,730
He used to say that half of his soul
was still there in that village.

167
00:11:32,850 --> 00:11:35,980
Adai Village? Hey, you're right!
That has to be where he is!

168
00:11:36,230 --> 00:11:38,400
- I'm gonna punch it, Kinon!
- Right!

169
00:11:42,110 --> 00:11:47,780
Once, this impoverished village could
support no more than 50 people.

170
00:11:48,990 --> 00:11:54,920
Back then, survival always meant
that someone must be sacrificed.

171
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:59,550
On the surface, there is a world
where everyone can live.

172
00:11:59,710 --> 00:12:01,630
That's what I believed
as I fought.

173
00:12:01,920 --> 00:12:04,680
But I was wrong.

174
00:12:05,220 --> 00:12:10,930
In the end, I almost sacrificed
more lives than ever before.

175
00:12:13,270 --> 00:12:16,100
That sin must be atoned for.

176
00:12:17,610 --> 00:12:21,070
<font color=#FFC9B9>Gurren Lagann</font>

177
00:12:22,610 --> 00:12:26,110
<font color=#FFC9B9>Gurren Lagann</font>

178
00:12:28,830 --> 00:12:30,620
What the--?
What's happening?

179
00:12:30,700 --> 00:12:33,120
All Spiral systems
are starting up!

180
00:12:33,330 --> 00:12:34,870
The main engine
is powering up, too!

181
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:37,290
But why?! We're not done with
the system build yet!

182
00:12:39,300 --> 00:12:42,460
Spiral transference signal detected
moving at high speed.

183
00:12:45,720 --> 00:12:47,840
- Rossiu...
- Rossiu!

184
00:12:48,260 --> 00:12:50,560
Sins must be judged.

185
00:12:51,470 --> 00:12:54,730
I will atone for my own sin
at my own hand.

186
00:12:55,270 --> 00:12:56,640
- Rossiu!
- Rossiu!

187
00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:07,160
Spiral Realm Perceptual
Teleportation System engaged.

188
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:19,750
Wait for us, Rossiu!

189
00:13:19,840 --> 00:13:21,460
Please, don't die!

190
00:13:21,880 --> 00:13:23,050
- Rossiu!
- Rossiu!

191
00:13:33,930 --> 00:13:35,390
Gurren Lagann!

192
00:13:42,150 --> 00:13:43,190
Stay away!

193
00:13:43,280 --> 00:13:44,940
Don't!

194
00:13:51,200 --> 00:13:53,910
Rossiu!

195
00:13:56,410 --> 00:13:59,420
Grit those teeth!

196
00:14:14,560 --> 00:14:16,890
Have you come back to
your senses, Rossiu?

197
00:14:18,270 --> 00:14:21,100
I was belted like that, too.

198
00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:27,240
Everybody makes mistakes.
It's to be expected.

199
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:31,360
But when you do make a mistake, you
should be slugged by someone else.

200
00:14:33,080 --> 00:14:36,740
There's no need
to punish yourself.

201
00:14:37,790 --> 00:14:41,920
At the time, you might think that
it's a mistake you can never undo.

202
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:47,210
Even if it is, if we kick and struggle and fight
like hell, we'll move forward a little bit.

203
00:14:47,760 --> 00:14:53,010
I got knocked flat on my ass, and I was told
to believe in the me that believes in myself.

204
00:14:53,510 --> 00:14:57,720
That's probably how it should be.
At least that's what I think.

205
00:14:58,640 --> 00:15:02,560
You tried to do something that
I never could have done.

206
00:15:02,650 --> 00:15:04,480
What's wrong with that?

207
00:15:04,570 --> 00:15:06,730
Simon...

208
00:15:08,690 --> 00:15:11,650
Come on, Rossiu.
I need you.

209
00:15:19,830 --> 00:15:25,080
Actually, I guess there's someone else
who needs you even more than I do.

210
00:15:38,180 --> 00:15:40,600
I'm sorry, Kinon.

211
00:15:48,780 --> 00:15:52,360
What do you think, Rossiu? How does it
feel to be back in the cockpit again?

212
00:15:52,490 --> 00:15:55,490
- It really takes me back.
- It does, huh?

213
00:15:55,570 --> 00:15:58,120
Um, I'm not heavy, am I?

214
00:15:58,990 --> 00:16:01,870
Yes. You are.
You're very heavy.

215
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:04,210
I-I'll climb down, then.

216
00:16:04,290 --> 00:16:06,830
No, this is fine.

217
00:16:07,420 --> 00:16:09,300
Right now, I want to feel it.

218
00:16:09,380 --> 00:16:12,420
I want to feel what the weight
of a single human life is like.

219
00:16:13,510 --> 00:16:14,800
Jerk.

220
00:16:19,770 --> 00:16:24,270
Human beings are fascinating indeed,
aren't they, Rossiu?

221
00:16:26,400 --> 00:16:28,020
How could we have been so blind?

222
00:16:28,110 --> 00:16:31,190
They eluded our super-Spiral
scan sweeps by creating...

223
00:16:31,280 --> 00:16:35,700
...an imaginary oscillating time-space
located between the membranes...

224
00:16:36,160 --> 00:16:39,580
...of the dimensional universes we
call the 10th and 11th dimensions.

225
00:16:42,660 --> 00:16:45,790
I'm sorry, boys. I can't make
heads or tails of it, either.

226
00:16:46,960 --> 00:16:49,880
But this is definitely the
Anti-Spiral homeworld.

227
00:16:49,960 --> 00:16:51,550
How can you tell?

228
00:16:52,420 --> 00:16:54,380
That's... her ring!

229
00:16:54,470 --> 00:16:55,720
But why?

230
00:16:56,010 --> 00:16:58,010
What we call the universe
is constructed on ambiguity.

231
00:16:58,100 --> 00:17:00,640
It only becomes a fixed reality
when observed.

232
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:02,770
That is a fundamental law
of the universe.

233
00:17:02,890 --> 00:17:04,480
Even in a pocket universe,

234
00:17:04,560 --> 00:17:08,690
...an object that has been observed at one time
can be picked up on a Spiral scan.

235
00:17:13,990 --> 00:17:15,530
Maybe this is related to the
quantum universe theory...

236
00:17:15,610 --> 00:17:17,780
Rossiu, are you a monster
or something?

237
00:17:17,910 --> 00:17:20,240
This isn't like you people.

238
00:17:20,660 --> 00:17:24,250
Who cares about the explanation.
We know where it is, so we're going.

239
00:17:24,330 --> 00:17:27,120
Yes, what he said! It sounds like you
can reach it if you know where it is.

240
00:17:27,540 --> 00:17:29,960
With a fixed set of perceptual
dimensional coordinates,

241
00:17:30,040 --> 00:17:32,090
...instantaneous teleportation
is possible.

242
00:17:32,460 --> 00:17:35,630
That is how the Spiral Realm Perceptual
Teleportation System works.

243
00:17:35,920 --> 00:17:39,140
If you think of someone, it will
send you straight into their arms!

244
00:17:39,470 --> 00:17:41,220
Thinking of them
gives you wings!

245
00:17:41,310 --> 00:17:42,970
If you think of me,
you die.

246
00:17:43,100 --> 00:17:44,220
That's what
that warp was?

247
00:17:44,310 --> 00:17:48,640
In that case, we've already tested it.
Basically, spirit lets you fly anywhere.

248
00:17:50,110 --> 00:17:54,730
But we should also assume that the
enemy has warp capability, too.

249
00:17:54,900 --> 00:17:56,070
Good point.

250
00:17:56,150 --> 00:17:58,780
In which case, I'm not sure
if it's a good idea...

251
00:17:58,910 --> 00:18:00,780
...for Gurren Lagann to
leave Earth right now.

252
00:18:01,620 --> 00:18:04,040
- Feel free to go, Simon.
- Rossiu?

253
00:18:04,450 --> 00:18:07,370
While you're away,
I'll come up with something.

254
00:18:07,660 --> 00:18:09,290
So please, go.

255
00:18:09,460 --> 00:18:14,000
He's right, Simon! If you don't go after
all this, all that macho will go to waste!

256
00:18:14,300 --> 00:18:17,300
We've found the enemy's stronghold,
so we smash it.

257
00:18:17,880 --> 00:18:20,260
It's worked for us this far.

258
00:18:20,680 --> 00:18:22,220
Am I right?

259
00:18:23,680 --> 00:18:25,220
Guys...

260
00:18:25,520 --> 00:18:27,520
We ain't doing this for you.

261
00:18:27,600 --> 00:18:33,060
We want to put an end to this. We're tired of
all that rattling and rumbling on the surface.

262
00:18:40,820 --> 00:18:46,080
Okay, Anne? I'm heading off to the
edge of the galaxy for a bit, okay?

263
00:18:46,580 --> 00:18:49,040
Look forward to all the cool stories
I'll have when I get back.

264
00:18:53,540 --> 00:18:56,090
- Kiyoh, I need to talk to--
- You can go.

265
00:18:57,010 --> 00:18:58,840
That's what you wanted
to talk about, right?

266
00:18:59,340 --> 00:19:00,220
Are you sure?

267
00:19:00,340 --> 00:19:03,010
This is Team Dai-Gurren's
last big fight, right?

268
00:19:03,140 --> 00:19:06,600
How can Littner Village's Dayakka
sit on the sidelines?

269
00:19:08,020 --> 00:19:10,850
I'm so lucky to have you!

270
00:19:10,980 --> 00:19:14,480
I'm so lucky I married you!

271
00:19:15,320 --> 00:19:18,900
You big lug. But make sure you
protect the Earth, okay?

272
00:19:19,360 --> 00:19:21,490
And make sure you
come home to me.

273
00:19:21,820 --> 00:19:24,070
I will! I promise!

274
00:19:24,160 --> 00:19:26,200
Oh, come on, quit crying!

275
00:19:26,330 --> 00:19:28,620
Guys sure are idiots,
aren't they?

276
00:19:39,720 --> 00:19:42,470
Dimensional anchors have penetrated
imaginary space.

277
00:19:42,550 --> 00:19:44,470
They've latched onto
the moon.

278
00:19:44,600 --> 00:19:45,800
Dayakka! Give the word!

279
00:19:46,350 --> 00:19:50,060
Engine output, 50%!
All ahead slow!

280
00:19:50,770 --> 00:19:54,980
Engine output, 50%!
All ahead slow!

281
00:20:04,450 --> 00:20:06,120
Wow, it actually came out.

282
00:20:06,240 --> 00:20:08,660
So, that's the real moon.

283
00:20:08,910 --> 00:20:11,410
With this here, the
Cathedral Terra can leave...

284
00:20:11,500 --> 00:20:14,420
...without worrying about
it affecting Earth.

285
00:20:14,670 --> 00:20:17,710
Anything could happen now,
and I wouldn't be surprised.

286
00:20:18,590 --> 00:20:20,170
M-Me, neither.

287
00:20:21,050 --> 00:20:23,340
Sorry. I know how
big a job this is.

288
00:20:23,800 --> 00:20:25,260
You can count on us.

289
00:20:25,340 --> 00:20:29,810
Even if you don't return,
I'll see to it that humanity survives.

290
00:20:30,140 --> 00:20:32,140
We'll kick and scream
and fight like hell.

291
00:20:32,640 --> 00:20:34,310
You bet.

292
00:20:35,850 --> 00:20:37,770
- Old Coco?
- What are you doing here?

293
00:20:38,440 --> 00:20:39,900
What's the matter?

294
00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:41,230
Hey, this is--

295
00:20:44,660 --> 00:20:46,410
Thanks, Old Coco.

296
00:20:46,740 --> 00:20:49,660
I'll bring Nia back,
count on it.

297
00:20:51,040 --> 00:20:53,290
It's Team Dai-Gurren's flag!

298
00:20:53,710 --> 00:20:57,790
Yes. And it's also the same flag
we flew when we took Teppelin.

299
00:21:00,550 --> 00:21:02,800
This is the actual flag?

300
00:21:03,260 --> 00:21:05,470
- Guinble.
- Sir?

301
00:21:06,220 --> 00:21:08,010
I hope I can count on
your continued support.

302
00:21:10,010 --> 00:21:11,180
Yes, sir!

303
00:21:22,230 --> 00:21:24,990
I'll be back, Bro.

304
00:21:40,880 --> 00:21:43,750
Sorry to keep you waiting, guys.

305
00:21:44,420 --> 00:21:47,050
Super Galaxy Dai-Gurren, launch!

306
00:21:47,300 --> 00:21:49,510
Super Galaxy Dai-Gurren?

307
00:21:49,760 --> 00:21:52,720
That's right! She's the
Super Galaxy Dai-Gurren!

308
00:21:53,020 --> 00:21:57,230
It works. It's a much better fit for
you people than Cathedral Terra.

309
00:21:58,400 --> 00:21:59,440
It sure does.

310
00:21:59,520 --> 00:22:02,020
Kittan. Leeron. Dayakka.

311
00:22:02,270 --> 00:22:04,030
Zorthy. Kid. Iraak.

312
00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:06,110
Jorgun. Balinbow. Makken.

313
00:22:06,490 --> 00:22:07,900
Tetukan. Gabal.
Aretenborough.

314
00:22:08,320 --> 00:22:10,530
Gimmy. Darry.
Cybela. Leyte.

315
00:22:10,910 --> 00:22:12,830
Yoko. Viral.
Lordgenome.

316
00:22:13,120 --> 00:22:14,410
And Boota.

317
00:22:15,450 --> 00:22:20,170
As long as Team Dai-Gurren stands united,
we have nothing to fear!

318
00:22:21,710 --> 00:22:23,130
Engines to full!

319
00:22:23,380 --> 00:22:26,130
Spiral Realm Perceptual
Teleportation System, activate!

320
00:22:26,630 --> 00:22:30,510
Let's go.
This is our final battle.

321
00:22:31,140 --> 00:22:35,140
