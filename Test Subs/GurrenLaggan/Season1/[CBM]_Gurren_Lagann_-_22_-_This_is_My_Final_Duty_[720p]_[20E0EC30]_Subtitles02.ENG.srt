1
00:00:10,670 --> 00:00:15,470
Gurren Lagann

2
00:00:15,470 --> 00:00:20,780
<font color=#FFFF00>Sugita kisetsu wo nageku hima ha nai
</font>I don't have the time to lament the seasons that have passed

3
00:00:20,780 --> 00:00:26,350
<font color=#FFFF00>Nido to mayotte shimawanu you ni
</font>So that I won't ever waver again

4
00:00:26,350 --> 00:00:31,660
<font color=#FFFF00>Kazoekirenai hon no sasayaka na
</font>With countless, tiny little

5
00:00:31,660 --> 00:00:36,560
<font color=#FFFF00>Sonna koukai kakaeta mama
</font>Regrets carried in my arms

6
00:00:36,660 --> 00:00:42,640
<font color=#FFFF00>Sono senaka dake oikakete koko made kitanda
</font>I've come this far, having chased only after your back

7
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:48,040
<font color=#FFFF00>Sagashite ita boku dake ni dekiru koto
</font>It's something only I, who sought you, can do

8
00:00:48,100 --> 00:00:53,110
<font color=#FFFF00>Ano hi kureta kotoba ga ima demo
</font>Those words you gave me that day, even now,

9
00:00:53,200 --> 00:00:58,940
<font color=#FFFF00>Kono mune ni tashika ni todoite iru kara
</font>Definitely reach my heart

10
00:00:59,050 --> 00:01:04,210
<font color=#FFFF00>Kinou yori mo kyou ha bu ha boku no
</font>I've realized my reason for having been born

11
00:01:04,250 --> 00:01:09,960
<font color=#FFFF00>Umarete kita wake ni kidzuite yuku
</font>Today more than I did yesterday

12
00:01:10,100 --> 00:01:18,830
<font color=#FFFF00>Kotae ha sou itsumo koko ni aru
</font>The answer, yes, is always right here

13
00:01:35,050 --> 00:01:39,720
In a spinning body, its axis of rotation
will always point in the same direction...

14
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:42,350
...even when force
is applied to it.

15
00:01:42,970 --> 00:01:46,600
The so-called gyroscopic effect. One of
the fundamental laws of the universe.

16
00:01:47,640 --> 00:01:49,520
It's the strangest thing.

17
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:52,610
Until seven years ago, I was one of the
hereditary guards of the Littner armory.

18
00:01:53,110 --> 00:01:58,530
I was a man who could barely read, and now
I can fine-tune a gigantic battleship like this.

19
00:01:59,160 --> 00:02:01,200
Every once in a while,
I frighten myself.

20
00:02:01,370 --> 00:02:03,910
Is this another form of
the Spiral Power awakening?

21
00:02:05,120 --> 00:02:07,500
What're you doing in there
talking to yourself?!

22
00:02:07,620 --> 00:02:09,500
If we don't do something,
this ship will be destroyed!

23
00:02:11,170 --> 00:02:13,250
We've already done everything
that we CAN do.

24
00:02:18,010 --> 00:02:22,640
Right. The faster we spin, the more we
break free of the bonds of gravity...

25
00:02:23,050 --> 00:02:24,890
...and aim for the heavens.

26
00:02:27,310 --> 00:02:28,430
And there it is!

27
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:32,310
Now, show us what lies beyond
those heavens we've aimed for!

28
00:02:33,060 --> 00:02:37,570
The Spiral Path, in which the twin paths
of man and beast wind and intersect!

29
00:02:38,070 --> 00:02:40,530
Join with yesterday's enemy
to smash fate!

30
00:02:40,610 --> 00:02:43,030
And grab hold of tomorrow's path
with our own hands!

31
00:02:43,320 --> 00:02:46,120
Destiny Combining!
Gurren Lagann!

32
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:50,330
Who the hell do you
think I am?!

33
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:05,510
<b>Episode 22:
This is My Final Duty</b>

34
00:03:05,810 --> 00:03:09,470
Amazing... That shockwave just now
destroyed over half of the small Mugann.

35
00:03:11,350 --> 00:03:12,770
That's a--

36
00:03:12,850 --> 00:03:16,230
There's a massive energy buildup on the
lunar surface behind the jumbo Mugann!

37
00:03:18,570 --> 00:03:19,780
What the--?

38
00:03:26,580 --> 00:03:29,290
Giant beam firing platform
detected on lunar surface!

39
00:03:29,410 --> 00:03:31,410
I wonder if its target
was Gurren Lagann?

40
00:03:31,660 --> 00:03:35,330
Simon! Leave the Arc-Gurren to us,
you deal with the moon!

41
00:03:35,710 --> 00:03:36,920
Got it!

42
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:44,640
- Let's go, you bozos!
- Yeah!

43
00:04:04,410 --> 00:04:07,740
Wow, look at how many Kittan and the gang
destroyed in their first space attack.

44
00:04:08,120 --> 00:04:10,240
The small Mugann have
pretty much been wiped out.

45
00:04:10,700 --> 00:04:14,580
Simon... Kittan...
Jorgun! Balinbow!

46
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:18,340
I knew it...
You guys came.

47
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,170
Good news, isn't it?

48
00:04:21,260 --> 00:04:23,340
- Awesome...
- Yeah.

49
00:04:26,220 --> 00:04:29,600
My Dayakkaiser!
Who the hell is piloting it?!

50
00:04:38,110 --> 00:04:40,320
Gimmy!
Pay attention!

51
00:04:40,480 --> 00:04:41,690
Y-Yoko?

52
00:04:42,990 --> 00:04:45,450
Any more daydreaming out of you, and I'll
make you stand out in the hallway!

53
00:04:46,740 --> 00:04:48,700
You sound like
a school teacher...

54
00:04:48,780 --> 00:04:51,160
Remaining Grapearl units,
form up on me!

55
00:04:51,240 --> 00:04:53,160
Don't let the old-timers
show us up!

56
00:04:53,500 --> 00:04:55,910
Spiral energy is recovering!

57
00:04:57,380 --> 00:05:00,340
Is it because of them?
Is this the power of hope?

58
00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:04,800
If that's true, then what have
I been doing all this time?

59
00:05:05,260 --> 00:05:09,470
Divert all energy to Spiral shields!
Protect the ship at all costs!

60
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:10,800
Roger!

61
00:05:12,100 --> 00:05:15,350
Viral, we'll destroy that cannon
before it gets off another shot.

62
00:05:15,890 --> 00:05:17,440
You're giving me orders now?

63
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:19,440
It's not an order.
It's a suggestion.

64
00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:21,360
In that case, I accept!

65
00:05:27,200 --> 00:05:30,530
Double Boomerang Spiral!

66
00:05:47,630 --> 00:05:48,720
What the--?

67
00:05:52,220 --> 00:05:53,560
As if!

68
00:06:20,420 --> 00:06:23,090
The moon...
Go to the moon.

69
00:06:23,590 --> 00:06:25,710
It is my...

70
00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:26,760
What was that?

71
00:06:26,840 --> 00:06:29,470
- The moon... Go to the moon.
- Is he accessing new information?

72
00:06:29,760 --> 00:06:33,260
- No, in his case, he's recalling old memories.
- It is my...

73
00:06:33,350 --> 00:06:34,100
The moon...

74
00:06:35,260 --> 00:06:39,060
I'm getting massive power readings
from the two giant Mugann!

75
00:07:00,710 --> 00:07:01,710
Lordgenome!

76
00:07:01,790 --> 00:07:05,290
They're focusing on us this time?
I tell you, it's not easy to be so popular.

77
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,050
Arc-Gurren, we're on our way!

78
00:07:08,970 --> 00:07:10,090
Damn!

79
00:07:19,770 --> 00:07:23,150
Don't cry. Don't cry, now.
Everything will be okay.

80
00:07:23,270 --> 00:07:26,520
Stay calm, everyone. It'll take more
than this to destroy this ship.

81
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:29,070
My people will keep us safe.

82
00:07:36,330 --> 00:07:39,370
The Arc-Gurren can't take
much more of this...

83
00:07:40,040 --> 00:07:41,870
Rossiu, don't give up!

84
00:07:42,040 --> 00:07:44,540
We've always held out
until the very last second.

85
00:07:44,710 --> 00:07:47,960
It's just like when we stole Dai-Gurren!
And when we took Teppelin!

86
00:07:48,250 --> 00:07:51,170
We hung in there until the last second and
snatched victory from the jaws of defeat!

87
00:07:51,760 --> 00:07:53,630
Yes, it was always
like that for YOU...

88
00:07:53,720 --> 00:07:56,220
Now, now, none of
that whining.

89
00:07:56,390 --> 00:07:57,930
Leeron? What are you doing?

90
00:07:58,510 --> 00:08:04,640
Don't you remember? The Arc-Gurren is
a giant Gunmen, just like Teppelin!

91
00:08:10,570 --> 00:08:13,570
That's right! We snatch victory
from the jaws of defeat!

92
00:08:13,820 --> 00:08:17,740
And that's what we'll keep doing...
As many times as it takes!

93
00:08:18,030 --> 00:08:21,410
I swear, it's never a dull moment
with you around!

94
00:08:32,760 --> 00:08:34,630
Let's do it, Arc-Gurren!

95
00:08:35,930 --> 00:08:38,350
- Simon?
- Is he gonna ram them?

96
00:08:38,510 --> 00:08:41,100
Move it, move it,
make a hole!

97
00:08:46,940 --> 00:08:48,360
That's--

98
00:08:48,610 --> 00:08:50,820
We've combined
with Gurren Lagann?!

99
00:08:52,650 --> 00:08:54,860
We're getting a massive
influx of Spiral energy!

100
00:08:54,990 --> 00:08:57,820
What's this signal we're receiving?
It's a transformation signal!

101
00:08:58,320 --> 00:09:00,830
Adjusting shipboard gravity
to match transformation!

102
00:09:02,410 --> 00:09:04,290
Assuring integrity of
living quarters!

103
00:09:04,410 --> 00:09:07,000
Okay, Simon!
Hit it!

104
00:09:34,280 --> 00:09:37,530
Giga Drill, spin on!

105
00:09:45,370 --> 00:09:47,580
Smashing through both
karma and fate!

106
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,630
The screams of life
echo through the galaxy!

107
00:09:51,880 --> 00:09:57,380
Raging Wave Combining!
Arch-Gurren Lagann!

108
00:10:10,610 --> 00:10:12,230
But that's--
I don't believe it!

109
00:10:12,520 --> 00:10:14,070
What the hell is that?!

110
00:10:14,190 --> 00:10:16,030
They transformed
something that big?

111
00:10:16,150 --> 00:10:18,820
Good job spotting this.
We can always count on you, Leeron.

112
00:10:18,900 --> 00:10:22,990
I don't want just your words of praise!
I want your burning heart, too!

113
00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:24,490
Can I kill him?

114
00:10:24,580 --> 00:10:25,950
Let it go.

115
00:10:26,120 --> 00:10:28,120
For now, we need to start
with this thing.

116
00:10:34,750 --> 00:10:37,130
Oh, so they can combine, too?

117
00:10:38,420 --> 00:10:39,880
C'mon!

118
00:10:47,060 --> 00:10:51,520
Arch-Gurren Lagann, full power!

119
00:10:57,690 --> 00:10:59,360
Let's do it, Viral!

120
00:10:59,820 --> 00:11:01,660
Suits me fine!

121
00:11:05,700 --> 00:11:08,200
Have a taste of the
Space-time Shattering...

122
00:11:08,290 --> 00:11:10,210
...Burst Spinning...

123
00:11:10,870 --> 00:11:12,580
...Punch!

124
00:11:30,270 --> 00:11:33,140
Is that Simon's power?

125
00:11:33,270 --> 00:11:37,730
Right. It's always Simon who unleashes
unbelievable power at the last moment.

126
00:11:38,360 --> 00:11:39,940
Sure looks that way...

127
00:11:40,070 --> 00:11:41,990
What's that hole?

128
00:11:42,110 --> 00:11:44,280
Looks like a hole in the
fabric of space and time.

129
00:11:44,410 --> 00:11:46,990
He sent it flying to the far end
of the space-time continuum.

130
00:11:47,280 --> 00:11:48,620
Amazing...

131
00:11:48,950 --> 00:11:51,910
This is the awakening of
Spiral Power, isn't it?

132
00:11:53,920 --> 00:11:55,880
Now, then...

133
00:11:56,460 --> 00:11:58,670
All we need to do now is push
this thing back into place!

134
00:12:03,630 --> 00:12:07,100
<font color=#FFC9B9>Gurren Lagann</font>

135
00:12:08,640 --> 00:12:12,100
<font color=#FFC9B9>Gurren Lagann</font>

136
00:12:58,770 --> 00:13:00,360
It's getting hot in here...

137
00:13:00,860 --> 00:13:05,030
It'll be entering the atmosphere soon.
It's dangerous, so return to the ship.

138
00:13:05,150 --> 00:13:06,320
But we haven't--

139
00:13:06,410 --> 00:13:08,990
Let Arch-Gurren Lagann
take it from here.

140
00:13:09,580 --> 00:13:10,990
Look at that!

141
00:13:23,460 --> 00:13:25,760
The moon was another
gigantic machine?

142
00:13:26,050 --> 00:13:28,430
Either way, we're gonna
stop it in its tracks!

143
00:13:33,930 --> 00:13:35,770
Yes, that is my flagship.

144
00:13:35,890 --> 00:13:38,140
The biocomputer has reactivated!

145
00:13:38,270 --> 00:13:39,810
You recognize it, Lordgenome?

146
00:13:39,860 --> 00:13:40,770
Lordgenome?!

147
00:13:40,860 --> 00:13:45,400
Don't worry, it's a biocomputer
that we generated from his cells.

148
00:13:45,820 --> 00:13:48,280
It's not like we completely
brought him back to life.

149
00:13:48,360 --> 00:13:49,860
Reprehensible...

150
00:13:49,950 --> 00:13:51,240
It was necessary.

151
00:13:51,370 --> 00:13:53,580
Is that you, Viral?

152
00:13:53,740 --> 00:13:57,750
Don't be angry. I must say, this is
a rather fascinating experience.

153
00:13:58,620 --> 00:14:00,960
I see you've changed, Spiral King.

154
00:14:01,130 --> 00:14:03,590
Yes, perhaps I have.

155
00:14:03,840 --> 00:14:07,800
Perhaps it's because I've been set free
from the yoke of my flesh.

156
00:14:09,090 --> 00:14:11,140
Atmospheric entry
in five minutes!

157
00:14:11,510 --> 00:14:15,100
Maybe it really is hopeless.
It's just too big!

158
00:14:15,220 --> 00:14:18,390
I'm not about to give up,
not after coming this far!

159
00:14:19,060 --> 00:14:20,350
What's all this?

160
00:14:23,070 --> 00:14:27,780
Insert your source of Spiral Power here.
The moon will come under your control.

161
00:14:28,280 --> 00:14:29,900
Under my control?

162
00:14:30,110 --> 00:14:33,830
The moon is my flagship,
the Cathedral Terra.

163
00:14:33,950 --> 00:14:35,580
It's another Gunmen?

164
00:14:35,910 --> 00:14:39,250
Judging from the size of the hole,
it looks like it takes a Giga Core Drill.

165
00:14:39,670 --> 00:14:41,920
You want me to fly in
with Gurren Lagann, huh?

166
00:14:42,170 --> 00:14:45,170
Gimmy, Darry!
Take over the controls!

167
00:14:45,550 --> 00:14:46,630
- Right!
- Right!

168
00:14:56,020 --> 00:14:59,600
Let's give it all we've got, Gimmy. We have
to buy Simon as much time as possible.

169
00:14:59,890 --> 00:15:03,860
Hang in there, Grapearl! Mass-production
models have their pride, too!

170
00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:07,320
Three minutes to
atmospheric entry!

171
00:15:07,570 --> 00:15:11,780
Did you hear that, Gimmy and Darry?
Do what you can to give us an extra minute.

172
00:15:12,030 --> 00:15:16,280
And then, a minute before entry,
Arch-Gurren Lagann will disengage.

173
00:15:19,830 --> 00:15:23,670
I will protect the 180,000 lives
aboard this ship.

174
00:15:23,960 --> 00:15:27,880
No matter how much scorn you heap
on me, that is my final duty.

175
00:15:29,170 --> 00:15:30,510
- Roger.
- Roger.

176
00:15:39,730 --> 00:15:41,390
That's the heart of
the machine, huh?

177
00:15:41,560 --> 00:15:43,940
We're nearly out of time!
Go!

178
00:15:51,400 --> 00:15:52,650
Nia?

179
00:15:53,320 --> 00:15:54,860
Get out of the way, Nia!

180
00:15:54,990 --> 00:15:59,540
I'm afraid that I can't do that.
I am the messenger of the Anti-Spiral.

181
00:15:59,950 --> 00:16:03,750
Causing the extinction of you
Spiral lifeforms is my mission.

182
00:16:03,960 --> 00:16:05,920
Spare me the speeches.
Stand aside.

183
00:16:06,090 --> 00:16:09,710
Then insert that drill,
crushing me in the process.

184
00:16:10,010 --> 00:16:11,420
If that's the way
you want it!

185
00:16:11,510 --> 00:16:13,840
Wait, Viral!
Lordgenome says not to!

186
00:16:13,970 --> 00:16:14,970
He what?!

187
00:16:15,550 --> 00:16:20,010
Her body is composed of the same
energy blocks as the Mugann.

188
00:16:20,560 --> 00:16:23,310
If you crush her, it will
cause an explosion,

189
00:16:23,390 --> 00:16:25,650
...and the control system
will be destroyed.

190
00:16:25,730 --> 00:16:28,900
What...?
But we're so close...

191
00:16:28,980 --> 00:16:31,780
That is absolute despair.

192
00:16:32,150 --> 00:16:33,070
What?

193
00:16:33,150 --> 00:16:36,950
The survival instinct is incredibly
strong in you Spiral races.

194
00:16:37,320 --> 00:16:40,830
That is why we extinguish one by one
every ray of hope left to you.

195
00:16:41,250 --> 00:16:45,330
When there appears to be hope, but then
you learn it is beyond your reach,

196
00:16:45,620 --> 00:16:48,290
...that is when your despair
is the deepest.

197
00:16:50,630 --> 00:16:53,340
The appearance of the Mugann.
The falling of the moon.

198
00:16:53,630 --> 00:16:55,800
The predicted destruction of
the underground shelters.

199
00:16:55,880 --> 00:16:57,800
The ambush in space.

200
00:16:57,930 --> 00:17:00,640
Is she saying these were
all calculated moves?

201
00:17:01,060 --> 00:17:03,600
How far does this all go?

202
00:17:04,350 --> 00:17:07,480
Yes. Terror and despair are the
most powerful deterrent...

203
00:17:07,560 --> 00:17:10,060
...for the magnifying nature
of Spiral Power.

204
00:17:11,150 --> 00:17:13,230
Are you sure about that?

205
00:17:13,740 --> 00:17:18,740
Nia, the way I see it, I think you've
been trying to toughen up humanity.

206
00:17:20,200 --> 00:17:24,250
No matter how dire the situation,
we've always risen to meet it.

207
00:17:24,580 --> 00:17:28,670
The more dire the situation you've put
us in, the stronger we've become.

208
00:17:28,920 --> 00:17:30,960
That's what's brought me
to this place.

209
00:17:31,090 --> 00:17:33,760
And that's what you hoped, too.
Tell me I'm wrong.

210
00:17:33,840 --> 00:17:36,510
You and I exist in
different dimensions.

211
00:17:36,630 --> 00:17:39,180
My past was entirely
a fictional creation.

212
00:17:39,340 --> 00:17:41,890
Your words mean nothing
to me.

213
00:17:42,220 --> 00:17:44,640
- You're wrong.
- It is a fact.

214
00:17:45,520 --> 00:17:50,310
If that's true... If that's true,
why are you wearing that ring?

215
00:17:51,820 --> 00:17:53,150
What is--

216
00:17:53,230 --> 00:17:58,360
It's your desire. Your desire
to not let go of the past.

217
00:17:59,910 --> 00:18:02,660
Oh, that's it.
I finally get it now.

218
00:18:03,080 --> 00:18:07,080
I get why you appeared to me
at crucial times.

219
00:18:07,160 --> 00:18:09,540
To inflict absolute despair
upon you.

220
00:18:09,880 --> 00:18:11,960
I thought I just
told you that.

221
00:18:12,290 --> 00:18:13,590
You're wrong.

222
00:18:13,960 --> 00:18:18,380
Maybe you don't realize it yourself,
but when you appeared to me,

223
00:18:18,630 --> 00:18:20,380
...you wanted me
to help you.

224
00:18:21,510 --> 00:18:22,800
Simon!

225
00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:25,470
I'm right here!

226
00:18:25,850 --> 00:18:29,310
Please! Help me!

227
00:18:30,770 --> 00:18:33,820
You're wrong.
I was--

228
00:18:34,190 --> 00:18:38,150
When we defeated Lordgenome, you said
you would head towards tomorrow.

229
00:18:38,650 --> 00:18:43,160
You and I built that future with the
people who came to the surface.

230
00:18:43,530 --> 00:18:45,910
Would you destroy
that yourself?

231
00:18:46,200 --> 00:18:49,410
I'm gonna grab hold of your future
with my own two hands!

232
00:18:49,710 --> 00:18:53,380
So get out of the way!
Please!

233
00:19:02,340 --> 00:19:04,430
Look, Simon!

234
00:19:24,030 --> 00:19:26,990
The moon is transforming!
It's a--

235
00:19:31,790 --> 00:19:33,460
It's a battleship type!

236
00:19:33,580 --> 00:19:37,380
Yes, that is my Cathedral Terra...

237
00:19:37,590 --> 00:19:40,050
I guess that means he managed
to take control of it.

238
00:19:43,340 --> 00:19:45,600
The moon battleship has
fired its retro rockets!

239
00:19:45,680 --> 00:19:48,600
It's slowly climbing back
into its old orbit.

240
00:19:51,560 --> 00:19:54,560
I guess he really did pull
a victory out of our hats.

241
00:19:58,320 --> 00:19:59,780
That's our Simon!

242
00:19:59,900 --> 00:20:02,990
That's for sure.
He's quite a man, isn't he?

243
00:20:13,750 --> 00:20:16,290
Thank you, Nia.

244
00:20:18,750 --> 00:20:21,380
But this will not change your fate.

245
00:20:21,470 --> 00:20:22,590
What?

246
00:20:22,670 --> 00:20:26,390
With the defusing of the
Humanity Annihilation System,

247
00:20:26,470 --> 00:20:29,760
...the Anti-Spiral will enter
a total war footing.

248
00:20:30,100 --> 00:20:33,810
If they set their minds to it, not
even you will be a match for them.

249
00:20:33,940 --> 00:20:38,400
The main Anti-Spiral fleet will
arrive in this galaxy...

250
00:20:38,480 --> 00:20:40,690
...to exterminate the human race
and their awakened Spiral Power.

251
00:20:40,860 --> 00:20:43,440
The fight isn't over yet, huh?

252
00:20:43,570 --> 00:20:47,490
If we win, will you go back
to your old self?

253
00:20:47,620 --> 00:20:50,830
I will be recalled to the
Anti-Spiral homeworld...

254
00:20:50,910 --> 00:20:53,540
...so that my data on you
can be analyzed.

255
00:20:53,710 --> 00:20:57,170
The likelihood of that is
infinitely close to zero.

256
00:20:57,420 --> 00:20:59,790
Maybe, but it isn't zero.

257
00:21:00,300 --> 00:21:04,340
As far as I'm concerned, that makes it
the same as a 100% chance.

258
00:21:04,970 --> 00:21:07,220
You will come to get me?

259
00:21:07,510 --> 00:21:11,140
Yeah. Who the hell
do you think I am?

260
00:21:15,270 --> 00:21:19,520
I am being recalled... to
the Anti-Spiral homeworld.

261
00:21:25,110 --> 00:21:28,990
NIA!

262
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:42,750
I can't hold a candle to him. In the end,
he overturned every plan set against him.

263
00:21:52,180 --> 00:21:54,680
The lunar impact
has been averted.

264
00:21:54,770 --> 00:21:57,480
The ship will return to the
Earth's surface momentarily.

265
00:22:00,610 --> 00:22:02,060
We can go home.

266
00:22:22,750 --> 00:22:25,710
Wait for me, Nia.

267
00:22:31,140 --> 00:22:35,140
To Be Continued...

Even warped and twisted roads
will snap into place...

290
00:24:09,030 --> 00:24:10,990
...if you kick reason to the curb
and give 'em a whack!

291
00:24:11,070 --> 00:24:15,030
Spirit and love change the universe! That's
how manly stubbornness shows itself!

<b>Let's Go, This is the Final Battle</b>

293

..."Let's Go, This is
