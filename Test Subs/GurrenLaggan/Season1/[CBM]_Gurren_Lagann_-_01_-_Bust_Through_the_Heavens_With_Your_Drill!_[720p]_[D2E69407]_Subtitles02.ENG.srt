1
00:00:10,670 --> 00:00:15,510
Gurren Lagann

2
00:00:15,580 --> 00:00:18,110
<font color=#FFFF00>Kimi ha kikoeru?
</font>Can you hear it?

3
00:00:18,250 --> 00:00:26,250
<font color=#FFFF00>Boku no kono koe ga yami ni munashiku suikomareta
</font>This voice of mine was sucked emptily into darkness

4
00:00:26,600 --> 00:00:31,700
<font color=#FFFF00>Moshimo sekai ga imi wo motsu no nara
</font>If the world has meaning to it,

5
00:00:32,030 --> 00:00:36,570
<font color=#FFFF00>Konna kimochi mo muda de ha nai
</font>Then these kinds of feelings aren't futile

6
00:00:36,910 --> 00:00:42,610
<font color=#FFFF00>Akogare ni oshitsubusarete akirametetanda
</font>I was crushed by my longing and had given up

7
00:00:42,910 --> 00:00:47,870
<font color=#FFFF00>Hateshinai sora no iro mo shiranaide
</font>Without even knowing the color of the endless sky

8
00:00:48,280 --> 00:00:53,190
<font color=#FFFF00>Hashiridashita omoi ga ima demo
</font>I began to run, because my feelings, even now,

9
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:58,960
<font color=#FFFF00>Kono mune wo tashika ni tataiteru kara
</font>Are definitely beating against my heart

10
00:00:59,230 --> 00:01:04,030
<font color=#FFFF00>Kyou no boku ga sono saki ni tsudzuku
</font>The me of today will continue towards our destination

11
00:01:04,500 --> 00:01:10,060
<font color=#FFFF00>Bokura nari no asu wo kizuite yuku
</font>We'll amass our own tomorrows

12
00:01:10,410 --> 00:01:18,900
<font color=#FFFF00>Kotae ha sou itsumo koko ni aru
</font>The answer, yes, is always right here

13
00:02:01,700 --> 00:02:03,580
Screening shield, class 8!

14
00:02:03,700 --> 00:02:05,580
Mirror armor plating
is detaching!

15
00:02:06,540 --> 00:02:08,620
Hit taken in block 3865!

16
00:02:08,710 --> 00:02:09,460
Damage?

17
00:02:09,540 --> 00:02:11,540
Minimal. But our thruster flame
sticks out like a sore thumb now!

18
00:02:11,580 --> 00:02:14,500
Stand fast, men.
Let's teach them something.

19
00:02:15,260 --> 00:02:17,210
Teach them exactly
who they are facing.

20
00:02:18,050 --> 00:02:20,050
Enemy fleet size
is off the charts!

21
00:02:20,140 --> 00:02:24,760
So, all the lights in the heavens
are our enemy, eh?

22
00:02:24,850 --> 00:02:27,100
They're worthy opponents.

23
00:02:27,180 --> 00:02:30,690
I'll take the fabric of space-time itself
and wring them out of existence!

24
00:02:32,730 --> 00:02:34,900
Prepare to fire
Maelstrom Cannon!

25
00:02:35,150 --> 00:02:37,650
Target the Great
Dimensional Waterfall!

26
00:02:39,490 --> 00:02:41,780
Gurren Lagann, spin on!

27
00:02:41,910 --> 00:02:43,910
Who the hell do you
think I am?

28
00:02:51,830 --> 00:02:57,460
<font color=#FFC9B9>Gurren Lagann</font>

29
00:02:57,710 --> 00:03:03,470
Episode 1:
Bust Through the Heavens With Your Drill!

30
00:03:04,890 --> 00:03:08,680
Digging tunnels.
Day after day, that's my job.

31
00:03:09,560 --> 00:03:12,690
The more we dig, the more
the village can expand.

32
00:03:13,860 --> 00:03:18,070
When the village chief is happy,
he feeds us pig-mole steaks.

33
00:03:18,940 --> 00:03:20,900
Is that why I dig?
For the steaks?

34
00:03:21,110 --> 00:03:22,650
No, not exactly.

35
00:03:36,130 --> 00:03:38,630
I also do it so I can
dig up treasure.

36
00:03:40,590 --> 00:03:42,590
C'mon, now!
Keep on digging!

37
00:03:49,020 --> 00:03:52,560
Hey, why can't you dig
like him?!

38
00:03:52,770 --> 00:03:55,310
Don't you want those steaks?!

39
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:01,440
Ew, it's Simon the Digger.

40
00:04:01,530 --> 00:04:05,450
What's the fun of getting covered
in dirt day after day?

41
00:04:05,530 --> 00:04:07,280
He's carrying
something weird, too.

42
00:04:07,370 --> 00:04:08,330
He's so gross...

43
00:04:08,410 --> 00:04:09,740
And he smells.

44
00:04:10,040 --> 00:04:10,950
He's looking this way!

45
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:13,750
If we're not careful, he might
drill a hole in us, too!

46
00:04:25,720 --> 00:04:27,930
Walk with your head
held high, Simon.

47
00:04:29,560 --> 00:04:30,560
Kamina?

48
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:34,230
Don't call me Kamina,
call me "Bro"!

49
00:04:35,140 --> 00:04:37,520
Um, I don't have any siblings,
so that's kind of...

50
00:04:37,610 --> 00:04:43,240
It's not about blood! We're soul
brothers, siblings of the spirit!

51
00:04:43,320 --> 00:04:46,530
Don't worry about what
those fugly chicks say.

52
00:04:46,820 --> 00:04:49,200
This looks good
on you, kid.

53
00:04:49,910 --> 00:04:53,290
Drills are your soul!
Come with me.

54
00:04:56,210 --> 00:04:59,130
Gentlemen! Sorry for the delay!
Is everything ready?!

55
00:04:59,250 --> 00:05:00,250
Yeah!

56
00:05:00,840 --> 00:05:01,880
What are you doing?

57
00:05:02,010 --> 00:05:05,720
Listen up, Simon. That drill
doesn't belong to the chief.

58
00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:07,840
That drill is who you are!

59
00:05:08,180 --> 00:05:11,720
Yours is the drill that will break
through the vault of heaven!

60
00:05:11,970 --> 00:05:12,760
Why?

61
00:05:13,220 --> 00:05:15,890
I have it all figured out!
Don't ask for a reason!

62
00:05:15,980 --> 00:05:17,890
Meaning that you
can't explain.

63
00:05:18,230 --> 00:05:20,230
Okay, you bozos!
Are we ready?!

64
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:21,360
Yeah!

65
00:05:21,650 --> 00:05:25,190
We're the invincible Team Gurren!
Nobody can stand in our way!

66
00:05:25,320 --> 00:05:26,650
Y-Yeah!

67
00:05:26,820 --> 00:05:28,740
We're sick of being cooped up
in this little town!

68
00:05:29,030 --> 00:05:31,240
It's the youth who are
gonna break out!

69
00:05:31,330 --> 00:05:35,040
Youth of this town,
aim for the surface!

70
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:42,040
Yahoo!

71
00:05:42,340 --> 00:05:46,010
Step aside! Make way!
Team Gurren is coming through!

72
00:05:47,880 --> 00:05:49,590
W-What now?!

73
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:54,220
Listen up, Simon! We're gonna use
your drill to bust through the ceiling!

74
00:05:54,310 --> 00:05:56,850
Bust through that, and the
next stop is the surface!

75
00:05:56,930 --> 00:05:59,770
We're gonna make a break
for the surface!

76
00:05:59,980 --> 00:06:01,310
This is insane!

77
00:06:01,400 --> 00:06:02,770
You can do it!

78
00:06:04,940 --> 00:06:06,190
When did you--

79
00:06:08,070 --> 00:06:10,610
Charge! Keep going
straight ahead!

80
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:17,870
Fly, piggies!

81
00:06:18,830 --> 00:06:21,500
Kamina! You again!

82
00:06:21,790 --> 00:06:23,290
Step aside, Chief!

83
00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:26,300
You little moron!

84
00:06:31,430 --> 00:06:33,800
Would you people PLEASE
come to your senses?

85
00:06:33,890 --> 00:06:36,310
This "surface" of yours
doesn't exist!

86
00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:39,270
Like hell it doesn't!
I've seen it!

87
00:06:39,350 --> 00:06:41,440
Up on the surface,
there's no walls! No ceiling!

88
00:06:41,730 --> 00:06:44,480
Instead, all you see around you
is a bright, blue sky!

89
00:06:44,570 --> 00:06:46,320
A liar's son is a liar,
too, I see.

90
00:06:46,440 --> 00:06:47,230
What?!

91
00:06:47,320 --> 00:06:50,570
Your old man did nothing but
spout crap like that, too.

92
00:06:50,660 --> 00:06:54,160
And what did it get him? Dead! Buried
under a pile of rocks somewhere!

93
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:57,790
You're wrong! My dad made it to
the surface! I was there with him!

94
00:06:57,870 --> 00:07:00,160
Then what are you doing
down here, smart guy?

95
00:07:00,290 --> 00:07:01,250
Um, well...

96
00:07:01,290 --> 00:07:02,960
Get this through your thick skulls!

97
00:07:03,040 --> 00:07:05,500
This village is all we have!

98
00:07:05,590 --> 00:07:10,260
For untold generations, we've been
warned to never unseal the canopy.

99
00:07:10,340 --> 00:07:13,140
People who don't understand
that rule don't get to eat!

100
00:07:13,430 --> 00:07:15,760
Into the stockade with you!
Without food!

101
00:07:17,180 --> 00:07:18,600
We're so sorry, sir!

102
00:07:18,770 --> 00:07:19,850
You weasels!

103
00:07:22,810 --> 00:07:24,520
Sorry about that, Bro!

104
00:07:24,650 --> 00:07:26,520
But no dinner is
a high price to pay...

105
00:07:26,650 --> 00:07:28,900
C'mon, Bro, swallow your
pride and apologize, too.

106
00:07:29,320 --> 00:07:31,150
You don't get to call me Bro.

107
00:07:31,280 --> 00:07:35,120
I don't ever wanna be called Bro
by the likes of you three!

108
00:07:37,490 --> 00:07:38,490
Hmph!

109
00:07:38,660 --> 00:07:41,660
The bonds of loyalty don't run too deep
in this Team Gurren of yours, I see.

110
00:07:41,750 --> 00:07:43,330
Simon, you come, too.

111
00:07:44,580 --> 00:07:48,090
I know that Kamina
roped you into helping him.

112
00:07:48,210 --> 00:07:50,880
You have an important job
here in Giha Village...

113
00:07:50,970 --> 00:07:53,220
...digging tunnels to
expand the village.

114
00:07:53,300 --> 00:07:56,090
You don't have to stay with
that idiot, so come along.

115
00:07:56,760 --> 00:07:59,060
- But I...
- Go ahead.

116
00:08:00,930 --> 00:08:03,270
Don't sweat it.
Go on.

117
00:08:09,730 --> 00:08:13,650
I-It's an earthquake!
Everybody take cover!

118
00:08:17,200 --> 00:08:19,240
Kamina! Let's get out of here!
Kamina!

119
00:08:20,370 --> 00:08:21,200
No way.

120
00:08:21,250 --> 00:08:22,000
But--

121
00:08:22,040 --> 00:08:23,370
I don't run from anything!

122
00:08:28,750 --> 00:08:31,250
If we don't run, we're gonna
get crushed here!

123
00:08:32,920 --> 00:08:36,130
Oh, right. I forgot what
happened to you.

124
00:08:37,350 --> 00:08:39,510
Don't worry, it's already
settling down.

125
00:08:43,730 --> 00:08:47,980
Are you people gonna keep living in
fear of earthquakes day after day?!

126
00:08:48,060 --> 00:08:50,690
Up on the surface,
there ain't no ceiling!

127
00:08:51,900 --> 00:08:53,650
Would you give it
a rest?!

128
00:08:53,780 --> 00:08:57,160
I didn't look after you orphaned kids
out of the goodness of my heart!

129
00:08:57,280 --> 00:08:58,870
It's because I'm
the chief!

130
00:08:58,990 --> 00:09:01,910
I have a duty to look out for the welfare
of this village and its citizens!

131
00:09:01,990 --> 00:09:06,790
But if you can't do as I tell you,
there's no place for you here!

132
00:09:12,550 --> 00:09:15,050
What are you doing
in here, too?

133
00:09:17,800 --> 00:09:19,220
That's a good boy.

134
00:09:20,100 --> 00:09:22,760
I guess I have myself some
emergency rations now.

135
00:09:23,770 --> 00:09:27,730
My parents died in an earthquake.
It happened when I was seven.

136
00:09:28,230 --> 00:09:30,400
No matter how many
holes I dig,

137
00:09:30,520 --> 00:09:34,110
...the ceiling is eventually gonna
fall in and crush me, the chief,

138
00:09:34,190 --> 00:09:37,030
...and everybody in the village,
and we're all gonna die.

139
00:09:37,110 --> 00:09:40,740
That's a given.
That's a fact of life.

140
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:42,370
Or is it?

141
00:09:55,550 --> 00:09:57,800
Lights out!
Lights out!

142
00:09:58,180 --> 00:10:01,260
Put out the lights!
It's now nighttime hours!

143
00:10:01,800 --> 00:10:07,230
Go to sleep, everyone!
Don't waste precious electricity!

144
00:10:07,520 --> 00:10:10,770
Grow up big and plump...
Grow up big and plump...

145
00:10:11,020 --> 00:10:13,820
Grow into a big,
juicy steak for me...

146
00:10:18,450 --> 00:10:19,450
What the hell?

147
00:10:19,570 --> 00:10:20,570
Kamina!

148
00:10:20,700 --> 00:10:22,280
Simon? What's up?

149
00:10:22,410 --> 00:10:24,950
Come with me! There's something
you've got to see!

150
00:10:25,290 --> 00:10:25,910
Hurry!

151
00:10:26,040 --> 00:10:28,750
Uh, that would be
a jailbreak.

152
00:10:29,870 --> 00:10:32,790
If the chief finds out,
there'll be hell to pay, Simon.

153
00:10:32,840 --> 00:10:35,880
I was so preoccupied
that didn't even occur to me.

154
00:10:36,170 --> 00:10:39,420
Well, if we get back by morning,
he'll be none the wiser.

155
00:10:39,800 --> 00:10:44,260
So, what's so important that I have
to bust out ofjail to see it?

156
00:10:44,390 --> 00:10:46,930
It's a face! It's this awesome,
humungous face!

157
00:10:50,390 --> 00:10:53,560
You've got some nerve, Kamina,
breaking out of jail!

158
00:10:53,980 --> 00:10:56,570
Simon, is this the humongous face
you were talkin' about?

159
00:10:57,440 --> 00:10:59,320
Don't you underestimate me, youngster!

160
00:10:59,610 --> 00:11:02,200
I'm the chief, so that means
I also stand guard!

161
00:11:02,530 --> 00:11:04,700
Simon, that goes
for you, too!

162
00:11:04,780 --> 00:11:07,790
I know all about those extra tunnels
you've been digging in secret!

163
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:11,790
Leave him alone. He hasn't done anything.
I'm the guilty party here.

164
00:11:12,330 --> 00:11:15,380
Oh, I'm perfectly aware
of how guilty you are!

165
00:11:49,290 --> 00:11:52,250
So, Simon. This thing
you wanted to show me...

166
00:11:52,540 --> 00:11:54,040
Is THIS it?

167
00:11:55,540 --> 00:11:58,960
<font color=#C99D93>Gurren Lagann</font>

168
00:12:00,460 --> 00:12:03,970
<font color=#FFC9B9>Gurren Lagann</font>

169
00:12:04,890 --> 00:12:09,510
Look up!
That's the surface!

170
00:12:09,640 --> 00:12:11,890
What did I tell you?
There's a surface, all right!

171
00:12:11,980 --> 00:12:15,730
This big mug fell from the surface!
It fell from above!

172
00:12:15,770 --> 00:12:17,440
Ain't that right, Mr. Chief?

173
00:12:24,360 --> 00:12:26,870
- It's a monster!
- Run, it's a monster!

174
00:12:33,330 --> 00:12:35,000
What are you
waiting for, Chief?

175
00:12:35,080 --> 00:12:37,710
I thought you said it was your duty
to protect the village.

176
00:12:38,290 --> 00:12:41,300
Gosh, it's hard to tell which of us
is the liar now, ain't it?

177
00:12:45,090 --> 00:12:47,260
Bro, this way!

178
00:12:47,340 --> 00:12:48,470
Bro?

179
00:12:50,850 --> 00:12:53,220
You've got guts,
plowing into my village...

180
00:12:53,520 --> 00:12:56,730
...with this big ugly mug
of yours, you know that?

181
00:12:57,310 --> 00:12:59,020
R-Run!

182
00:12:59,230 --> 00:13:03,110
But that ends here! I won't stand
for any more of your shenanigans!

183
00:13:03,530 --> 00:13:07,240
Wha--?
Who the hell are you?

184
00:13:07,660 --> 00:13:08,660
It talked!

185
00:13:10,160 --> 00:13:14,160
I'm gonna tell you, so dig the wax outta
those huge ears and listen close!

186
00:13:14,460 --> 00:13:16,870
The bad reputation of Team Gurren
echoes far and wide in Giha Village!

187
00:13:17,290 --> 00:13:19,670
When they talk about
its badass leader,

188
00:13:19,750 --> 00:13:22,750
...that man of indomitable spirit,
that paragon of masculinity,

189
00:13:23,210 --> 00:13:25,670
...they're talking about ME,
the mighty Kamina!

190
00:13:27,930 --> 00:13:28,840
Idiot.

191
00:13:28,930 --> 00:13:30,890
- What a dunce.
- Total dumbass.

192
00:13:32,260 --> 00:13:37,390
The mighty Kamina will not countenance
any further lawlessness in his village!

193
00:13:39,980 --> 00:13:42,690
What can a puny human like you
do to stop me?

194
00:13:57,540 --> 00:13:59,580
All right, you two!
Get back!

195
00:14:00,750 --> 00:14:02,090
Something else
from the surface?

196
00:14:02,170 --> 00:14:04,000
Yeah, it's a girl
this time.

197
00:14:13,140 --> 00:14:15,850
I only knocked it on its backside.
It'll get up again soon.

198
00:14:16,140 --> 00:14:17,770
Hey, baby, how ya doin'?

199
00:14:18,270 --> 00:14:20,810
You sluggin' it out with that thing?
Let me give you a hand.

200
00:14:20,900 --> 00:14:21,900
What?

201
00:14:21,980 --> 00:14:23,650
You came from
the surface, right?

202
00:14:23,730 --> 00:14:24,570
Pretty much.

203
00:14:24,650 --> 00:14:27,360
That's awesome. So, that's a weapon
they use on the surface, huh?

204
00:14:27,440 --> 00:14:29,360
Not exactly.
But something like that.

205
00:14:29,660 --> 00:14:34,160
Damn, you got a fine body!
Surface chicks are a breed apart!

206
00:14:34,910 --> 00:14:38,290
Do I need to tell you again to run?
Do you have a death wish?

207
00:14:45,800 --> 00:14:47,920
Thanks, Simon!
Nice save!

208
00:14:48,340 --> 00:14:49,510
Hurry, this way!

209
00:14:49,760 --> 00:14:51,470
- Where am I?
- Giha Village.

210
00:14:51,550 --> 00:14:53,090
Oh, this is the pit
next door.

211
00:14:53,220 --> 00:14:54,180
Next door?

212
00:14:54,220 --> 00:14:56,760
I'm from Littner Village,
the pit next to this one.

213
00:14:57,060 --> 00:15:00,480
What the hell? You said you're from the
surface, but you were raised in a pit?

214
00:15:00,600 --> 00:15:03,730
I came down from the surface just now,
but I originally hail from Littner.

215
00:15:03,810 --> 00:15:06,730
Geez, you're a pit chick?
Move it, thunder thighs!

216
00:15:06,980 --> 00:15:08,900
What's with the change
in attitude?

217
00:15:09,240 --> 00:15:10,240
This way.

218
00:15:10,610 --> 00:15:12,200
Where, exactly, are we going?

219
00:15:12,320 --> 00:15:13,530
- The face.
- The face?

220
00:15:13,620 --> 00:15:14,740
A humongous face!

221
00:15:14,830 --> 00:15:15,870
Do you mean a Gunmen?

222
00:15:16,080 --> 00:15:17,540
What the hell is a "Gunmen"?

223
00:15:17,790 --> 00:15:18,950
That is.

224
00:15:21,670 --> 00:15:24,630
Give me a minute. From here,
I can target its power conduits.

225
00:15:24,920 --> 00:15:27,050
If I can take those out,
it'll stop him in his tracks.

226
00:15:28,380 --> 00:15:29,130
Gotcha!

227
00:15:29,170 --> 00:15:30,670
Hey, you with the big mug!

228
00:15:31,130 --> 00:15:33,800
We're about to take you down with
one shot, so say your prayers!

229
00:15:38,470 --> 00:15:40,060
What did you do that for?!

230
00:15:40,270 --> 00:15:42,770
A man looks his opponent in the eye
when he lets him have it!

231
00:15:42,900 --> 00:15:44,850
I'm a woman,
thank you very much!

232
00:15:44,940 --> 00:15:47,570
A woman has no place meddling
in a fight between two men!

233
00:15:47,690 --> 00:15:49,530
I'm the one who's doing
all the fighting here!

234
00:15:50,150 --> 00:15:52,610
You've got spunk, lady!
I like your style!

235
00:15:55,370 --> 00:15:57,830
This is it? The face you
wanted to show me?

236
00:15:57,950 --> 00:15:58,700
Yep.

237
00:15:58,740 --> 00:16:01,330
This is TWO awesome things
you've dug up now, kid.

238
00:16:02,160 --> 00:16:04,500
I wonder if this is a friend
of the Gunmen up there?

239
00:16:04,580 --> 00:16:08,380
It's smaller than the thing up there,
but I like this thing's face.

240
00:16:08,460 --> 00:16:09,880
But look at this.

241
00:16:10,130 --> 00:16:12,220
People ride in it?
But that's impossible...

242
00:16:12,340 --> 00:16:13,220
Can you pilot it?

243
00:16:13,340 --> 00:16:16,760
Bro, let's use this to take out that
thing up there! That big face!

244
00:16:16,890 --> 00:16:18,100
Let's waste it.

245
00:16:19,310 --> 00:16:20,310
With this, huh?

246
00:16:20,350 --> 00:16:22,390
Yeah, Bro!
You can use this to--

247
00:16:22,690 --> 00:16:23,940
Huh?

248
00:16:26,610 --> 00:16:27,810
It looks like it's running!

249
00:16:28,020 --> 00:16:28,860
Really?

250
00:16:28,980 --> 00:16:30,690
C'mon, Bro!

251
00:16:32,610 --> 00:16:34,360
You do it, Simon.

252
00:16:35,200 --> 00:16:38,320
You're the one who dug this up.
That makes it yours.

253
00:16:38,620 --> 00:16:39,620
But I--

254
00:16:39,790 --> 00:16:44,410
What, you think the great Kamina could
steal stuff from his blood brother?

255
00:16:44,500 --> 00:16:45,210
What?

256
00:16:45,290 --> 00:16:47,080
Come on, I can't do this!

257
00:16:47,500 --> 00:16:48,670
Dumbass!

258
00:16:48,750 --> 00:16:51,170
Reject common sense to make
the impossible possible!

259
00:16:51,460 --> 00:16:54,630
That's the way
Team Gurren rolls, right?

260
00:16:55,010 --> 00:16:56,010
But...

261
00:17:02,310 --> 00:17:03,470
Just pilot the damn thing!

262
00:17:05,980 --> 00:17:08,480
Do it. If anyone can
do it, it's you.

263
00:17:09,110 --> 00:17:10,110
B-But...

264
00:17:10,230 --> 00:17:12,440
Listen, Simon.
Don't believe in yourself.

265
00:17:13,280 --> 00:17:16,570
Believe in ME! Believe in the
Kamina who believes in you!

266
00:17:16,990 --> 00:17:18,200
What's that supposed
to mean?

267
00:17:20,620 --> 00:17:22,120
I'll see what I can do.

268
00:17:59,320 --> 00:18:00,320
It worked!

269
00:18:13,130 --> 00:18:14,710
You did it, Simon!

270
00:18:15,130 --> 00:18:16,550
Yeah, Bro!

271
00:18:16,630 --> 00:18:17,800
Here we go!

272
00:18:20,640 --> 00:18:23,300
Why, that's--
Kamina and Simon?

273
00:18:25,850 --> 00:18:27,560
You weren't expecting THIS,
were ya, you Gunmen S.O.B.?

274
00:18:27,640 --> 00:18:31,850
Even if heaven itself tolerates your
brutality, the mighty Lagann doesn't!

275
00:18:32,230 --> 00:18:33,360
What's "Lagann"?

276
00:18:33,440 --> 00:18:36,230
This fella's name.
I just came up with it.

277
00:18:40,950 --> 00:18:43,200
Simon! Why are you dodging?
Quit running!

278
00:18:43,280 --> 00:18:45,540
But it's gonna kill us!

279
00:18:45,660 --> 00:18:48,160
A man never walks away
from a fight!

280
00:18:58,300 --> 00:18:59,510
We're on top of its head?!

281
00:19:05,930 --> 00:19:06,930
Bro!

282
00:19:09,640 --> 00:19:10,850
Stay away!

283
00:19:14,820 --> 00:19:19,070
R-Reject common sense to make
the impossible possible!

284
00:19:19,650 --> 00:19:21,900
That's the way
Team Gurren rolls!

285
00:19:27,240 --> 00:19:29,540
I'm coming, Bro!

286
00:19:33,210 --> 00:19:34,750
Simon! That was pretty slick!

287
00:19:34,880 --> 00:19:37,380
C'mon, jump!
Make it jump!

288
00:19:37,670 --> 00:19:39,800
Hey, quit wasting time!
Hurry!

289
00:19:58,440 --> 00:20:00,940
N-Nice work with
the canopy, Simon!

290
00:20:01,070 --> 00:20:02,860
It's a little cramped, though...

291
00:20:04,990 --> 00:20:06,820
Looks like we took it down.

292
00:20:06,910 --> 00:20:09,080
I guess this thing's head
is hard as a rock.

293
00:20:16,380 --> 00:20:18,670
I have you now!

294
00:20:20,800 --> 00:20:22,840
We're done for...
It's so cramped!

295
00:20:23,220 --> 00:20:25,380
Don't moan over a little
thing like this!

296
00:20:25,510 --> 00:20:28,680
Damn it... I need power...
If only I had more power!

297
00:20:44,490 --> 00:20:46,740
- A drill?
- It just sorta popped out.

298
00:20:46,820 --> 00:20:49,200
That's your kind of weapon!
It's a perfect match!

299
00:20:50,700 --> 00:20:53,000
Bro! I think I'll be able
to do the job with this!

300
00:20:53,330 --> 00:20:56,710
All right, then! Smash us
into that big mug!

301
00:20:56,830 --> 00:20:59,340
Give it a taste of the power
of Team Gurren's mighty drill!

302
00:20:59,380 --> 00:21:00,380
Yeah!

303
00:21:06,130 --> 00:21:09,510
Get going, Simon! Bust through
the heavens with your drill!

304
00:21:56,140 --> 00:21:59,400
Farewell, Giha Village!
We're off to the surface!

305
00:21:59,980 --> 00:22:01,860
Off to the surface
I saw as a kid!

306
00:22:31,350 --> 00:22:32,930
This is the surface?

307
00:22:44,520 --> 00:22:46,480
It's so beautiful...

308
00:22:46,650 --> 00:22:48,280
It's Yoko.

309
00:22:48,950 --> 00:22:52,240
That's my name.
I never introduced myself, did I?

310
00:22:52,740 --> 00:22:53,740
Come to think of it...

311
00:22:54,200 --> 00:22:56,700
I'm Kamina,
and this is Simon.

312
00:22:57,200 --> 00:22:58,200
Nice to meet you.

313
00:22:59,250 --> 00:23:03,460
Um, what's this furry thing that's
hiding out in my cleavage?

314
00:23:03,630 --> 00:23:05,130
Behave yourself, Boota!

315
00:23:05,210 --> 00:23:08,170
Whoa, breast meat
hiding among the breast meat...

316
00:23:08,220 --> 00:23:10,380
Is it just me,
or are we falling?

317
00:23:10,430 --> 00:23:12,590
Hey, the thrusters turned off!
Do something, Simon!

318
00:23:12,680 --> 00:23:14,800
I was caught up in the moment
earlier, I don't know how!

319
00:23:15,100 --> 00:23:16,890
- It's no use!
- You're sure quick to give up.

320
00:23:19,940 --> 00:23:22,060
We're falling!
Hold on tight!

321
00:23:35,700 --> 00:23:37,240
Talk about a rough reception...

322
00:23:38,290 --> 00:23:40,000
You can say that again...

323
00:23:41,370 --> 00:23:43,670
I-I'm sorry!

324
00:23:51,840 --> 00:23:54,430
Out of the frying pan,
into the fire, looks like...

325
00:24:00,930 --> 00:24:04,980
To Be Continued...

326
00:24:12,390 --> 00:24:18,620
<font color=#FFFF00>Hikari wo motomete kage ha tawainai jooku wo shaberu
</font>'Cuz they seek light, the shadows chatter out grade-school jokes

327
00:24:18,620 --> 00:24:24,600
<font color=#FFFF00>Kikitai no ha sonna koto ja nai
</font>I don't want to listen to that crap

328
00:24:31,070 --> 00:24:37,130
<font color=#FFFF00>Taiyou motomete kage ha tamashii no nuketa koe kara
</font>'Cuz they seek the sun, the shadows suddenly change from

329
00:24:37,130 --> 00:24:43,010
<font color=#FFFF00>Kyuu ni surudoi kuchou ni kawaru
</font>The soul's missing voice to a sharp tone of voice

330
00:24:43,170 --> 00:24:49,720
<font color=#FFFF00>Sono oto ga machi no naka ni kodama-shite hibikinagara
</font>While that sound echoed and bounced in the middle of town,

331
00:24:49,720 --> 00:24:55,760
<font color=#FFFF00>Kemono no you na koe de sakebitsudzuketa
</font>I kept on screaming in a beastly voice
