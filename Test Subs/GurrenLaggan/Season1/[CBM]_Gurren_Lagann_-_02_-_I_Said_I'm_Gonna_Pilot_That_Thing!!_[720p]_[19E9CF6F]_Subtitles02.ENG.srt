00:00:10,670 --> 00:00:15,510
Gurren Lagann

2
00:00:15,580 --> 00:00:18,110
<font color=#FFFF00>Kimi ha kikoeru?
</font>Can you hear it?

3
00:00:18,250 --> 00:00:26,250
<font color=#FFFF00>Boku no kono koe ga yami ni munashiku suikomareta
</font>This voice of mine was sucked emptily into darkness

4
00:00:26,600 --> 00:00:31,700
<font color=#FFFF00>Moshimo sekai ga imi wo motsu no nara
</font>If the world has meaning to it,

5
00:00:32,030 --> 00:00:36,570
<font color=#FFFF00>Konna kimochi mo muda de ha nai
</font>Then these kinds of feelings aren't futile

6
00:00:36,910 --> 00:00:42,610
<font color=#FFFF00>Akogare ni oshitsubusarete akirametetanda
</font>I was crushed by my longing and had given up

7
00:00:42,910 --> 00:00:47,870
<font color=#FFFF00>Hateshinai sora no iro mo shiranaide
</font>Without even knowing the color of the endless sky

8
00:00:48,280 --> 00:00:53,190
<font color=#FFFF00>Hashiridashita omoi ga ima demo
</font>I began to run, because my feelings, even now,

9
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:58,960
<font color=#FFFF00>Kono mune wo tashika ni tataiteru kara
</font>Are definitely beating against my heart

10
00:00:59,230 --> 00:01:04,030
<font color=#FFFF00>Kyou no boku ga sono saki ni tsudzuku
</font>The me of today will continue towards our destination

11
00:01:04,500 --> 00:01:10,060
<font color=#FFFF00>Bokura nari no asu wo kizuite yuku
</font>We'll amass our own tomorrows

12
00:01:10,410 --> 00:01:18,900
<font color=#FFFF00>Kotae ha sou itsumo koko ni aru
</font>The answer, yes, is always right here

13
00:01:32,250 --> 00:01:37,260
This is the tale of a man who has yet
to realize what his destiny is.

14
00:01:37,800 --> 00:01:40,720
Simon and Kamina live in
an underground village.

15
00:01:40,850 --> 00:01:43,930
But with the sudden appearance
of a Gunmen, a gigantic mecha,

16
00:01:44,140 --> 00:01:47,770
...and Yoko, a beautiful woman who
fires wildly with a superconducting rifle,

17
00:01:47,810 --> 00:01:50,400
...their daily routine is shattered.

18
00:01:50,690 --> 00:01:52,900
They attack and destroy
the enemy robot.

19
00:01:52,980 --> 00:01:56,280
The momentum of the attack carries
the trio up to the surface, but then...

20
00:01:57,280 --> 00:02:02,030
Episode 2:
I Said I'm Gonna Pilot That Thing!!

21
00:02:08,040 --> 00:02:09,410
Ambushing people
is playing dirty!

22
00:02:09,460 --> 00:02:11,130
Sorry, I forgot to tell you!

23
00:02:11,670 --> 00:02:12,790
These guys were up here
this whole time!

24
00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:13,500
Say what?

25
00:02:13,550 --> 00:02:15,380
Three of them jumped me
at once!

26
00:02:15,420 --> 00:02:17,630
The one that fell into your village
was one of them!

27
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:19,800
So what you're saying is, there's
lots of these things up here?!

28
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:21,430
That's for sure, the place
is crawling with them!

29
00:02:21,470 --> 00:02:23,680
- Glad to hear it!
- I hate this!

30
00:02:25,270 --> 00:02:26,220
What do you think
you're doing, Simon?

31
00:02:26,310 --> 00:02:29,640
I'm leaving! I'm going back down!
I'm going back to our village!

32
00:02:34,070 --> 00:02:36,400
Don't lose your
nerve now, Simon!

33
00:02:36,530 --> 00:02:38,490
You did such a great job fighting
them earlier, remember?

34
00:02:38,530 --> 00:02:40,030
That was just a fluke!

35
00:02:40,570 --> 00:02:42,530
I'll handle it, then!
Open the hatch!

36
00:02:47,370 --> 00:02:48,870
Listen up, you walking faces!

37
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:52,790
Having left his homeland, he never yields,
never retreats, and never regrets!

38
00:02:53,210 --> 00:02:57,750
Never retreat! Never look back!
Male tenacity is all about the never's!

39
00:02:57,840 --> 00:03:00,630
The great Kamina of Team Gurren
is gonna take you on!

40
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:02,010
You have been warned!

41
00:03:06,220 --> 00:03:07,220
Huh?

42
00:03:11,480 --> 00:03:13,020
You could've been killed, seriously!

43
00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:15,900
How long are you gonna
keep running, Simon?

44
00:03:18,030 --> 00:03:19,990
We finally made it
to the surface.

45
00:03:23,450 --> 00:03:25,990
Now's the time to cast off
the boy you used to be.

46
00:03:26,370 --> 00:03:27,370
It's now or never.

47
00:03:28,240 --> 00:03:30,410
Hold us steady, Simon!

48
00:03:37,630 --> 00:03:39,170
This is terrifying, Bro!

49
00:03:40,420 --> 00:03:42,470
Hold us steady, I said!
Sheesh!

50
00:03:56,860 --> 00:03:58,610
Um, hello?
We're falling.

51
00:04:03,530 --> 00:04:04,780
What's wrong, Simon?

52
00:04:05,160 --> 00:04:06,070
It's not working!

53
00:04:06,160 --> 00:04:06,990
Why not?

54
00:04:07,030 --> 00:04:08,330
I don't know!

55
00:04:09,580 --> 00:04:12,290
I can't do this anymore!
You do it, Bro!

56
00:04:12,540 --> 00:04:14,250
Simon! You--

57
00:04:14,370 --> 00:04:16,420
Save the family squabbles
for later!

58
00:04:27,300 --> 00:04:28,850
You okay, Yoko?

59
00:04:29,890 --> 00:04:30,890
Dayakka!

60
00:04:31,430 --> 00:04:32,430
Friends of yours?

61
00:04:32,640 --> 00:04:33,600
Yeah!

62
00:04:34,060 --> 00:04:36,350
Concentrate your fire
on the one in front!

63
00:04:44,150 --> 00:04:45,150
Something jumped out!

64
00:04:45,610 --> 00:04:47,110
Keep your heads down!

65
00:04:49,990 --> 00:04:51,870
Aw, my Gunmen...

66
00:04:53,450 --> 00:04:55,410
It's almost sunset.
We're pulling out.

67
00:04:55,580 --> 00:04:59,210
I'll remember this, you stinking humans!
We'll pick this up tomorrow!

68
00:04:59,630 --> 00:05:01,670
Show no mercy!
FIRE!

69
00:05:02,380 --> 00:05:03,920
Hot, hot, hot!

70
00:05:04,760 --> 00:05:07,470
You'll rue this day!

71
00:05:08,340 --> 00:05:10,470
That's what was inside
those things?

72
00:05:10,600 --> 00:05:13,850
Beastmen. They're what
pilot the Gunmen.

73
00:05:15,140 --> 00:05:17,100
Every day, they show up
when the sun rises...

74
00:05:17,230 --> 00:05:18,980
...and leave again
when the sun sets.

75
00:05:19,020 --> 00:05:19,860
How come?

76
00:05:19,900 --> 00:05:21,320
I have no idea!

77
00:05:21,650 --> 00:05:23,400
You've been fighting those things
your whole life?

78
00:05:24,030 --> 00:05:25,030
That's right!

79
00:05:26,530 --> 00:05:28,910
I'll fill you in on
all the details later.

80
00:05:33,700 --> 00:05:35,700
You did good today, Simon.

81
00:05:37,580 --> 00:05:39,580
It's hopeless...
I can't do this.

82
00:05:39,670 --> 00:05:42,630
Whenever my ass is in trouble,
you're always the one who saves it.

83
00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:45,130
Thanks a lot.

84
00:05:46,220 --> 00:05:47,800
Oh, my!

85
00:05:48,760 --> 00:05:52,300
What's this darling little fellow?
He's a handsome devil, isn't he?

86
00:05:54,310 --> 00:05:57,680
I didn't mean you,
I meant this mecha.

87
00:05:57,980 --> 00:05:58,520
Mecha?

88
00:05:58,640 --> 00:06:01,100
You know, this one
is just my type!

89
00:06:04,070 --> 00:06:07,490
What're you doing, Leeron?
Hurry up and help me strip this thing.

90
00:06:07,530 --> 00:06:09,240
Sure, I'm coming!

91
00:06:09,700 --> 00:06:11,200
See you later, hon.

92
00:06:12,530 --> 00:06:15,160
They've got all kinds up here
on the surface, looks like.

93
00:06:20,630 --> 00:06:22,330
I finally made it, Dad.

94
00:06:23,170 --> 00:06:26,050
Never mind. This sight is
something else, ain't it?

95
00:06:27,420 --> 00:06:29,510
The surface sure is different,
isn't it?

96
00:06:30,180 --> 00:06:33,180
That huge, round light,
and all them itty bitty lights...

97
00:06:33,470 --> 00:06:35,640
This place is full of lights
even at night.

98
00:06:35,720 --> 00:06:38,520
This is way better than the
pitch-black nights down in the pit.

99
00:06:39,480 --> 00:06:42,850
Yep. Coming up here
was the right call.

100
00:06:46,190 --> 00:06:49,490
The big light is the moon.
The "itty bitty" ones are called stars.

101
00:06:49,780 --> 00:06:52,110
That's what people called them,
way back in the past.

102
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:55,160
The moon and stars, huh?
Pretty simple names, ain't they?

103
00:06:56,080 --> 00:06:58,910
I wonder why they had names?

104
00:06:59,580 --> 00:07:02,370
If they have names, maybe that means
that people in the past...

105
00:07:02,500 --> 00:07:06,000
...used to look up at the lights
in the sky all the time.

106
00:07:06,050 --> 00:07:10,170
My goodness, you're not just
a pretty face, are you, hon?

107
00:07:10,510 --> 00:07:12,430
This mecha is fascinating!

108
00:07:12,510 --> 00:07:15,220
It may be small, but it's
packing a lot of power.

109
00:07:15,300 --> 00:07:16,260
What're you doing?

110
00:07:16,350 --> 00:07:18,470
Running some numbers.
Are you interested?

111
00:07:19,180 --> 00:07:20,560
A machine that makes
squiggly lines?

112
00:07:20,690 --> 00:07:22,940
Oh, you don't know
how to read?

113
00:07:23,020 --> 00:07:25,060
Read? Do you know how
to do that, Bro?

114
00:07:25,150 --> 00:07:25,810
Nope.

115
00:07:25,940 --> 00:07:27,690
Wow, what bumpkins...

116
00:07:27,780 --> 00:07:29,940
You aren't exactly a bookworm
yourself, missy.

117
00:07:30,070 --> 00:07:32,400
I can read just fine,
thank you very much!

118
00:07:32,740 --> 00:07:35,410
This one is "stars,"
and this one is "moon"!

119
00:07:37,830 --> 00:07:42,870
It's possible that long, long ago,
people used to live on the surface.

120
00:07:43,920 --> 00:07:44,880
Really?

121
00:07:45,040 --> 00:07:47,670
Some records say they did,
and others say that they didn't.

122
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:49,000
Which is it?

123
00:07:49,090 --> 00:07:51,340
It's like how I'm both and
neither a man nor a woman.

124
00:07:51,380 --> 00:07:53,430
Who cares?
Who ARE you, anyway?

125
00:07:53,720 --> 00:07:56,470
I'm Leeron, but you
can call me Ron.

126
00:07:56,550 --> 00:07:59,390
- Or "Beautiful Queen," if you like.
- I'd rather die!

127
00:07:59,720 --> 00:08:02,270
You'd never guess it, but Ron here
knows just about everything.

128
00:08:02,690 --> 00:08:05,060
He also handles all of our
weapons-related maintenance.

129
00:08:05,150 --> 00:08:06,980
- YOU do that?
- You find that strange?

130
00:08:07,270 --> 00:08:12,690
Fine, put my dexterity to the test.
Who knows, you might enjoy it.

131
00:08:14,110 --> 00:08:15,110
You die.

132
00:08:15,240 --> 00:08:16,450
Now, now...

133
00:08:16,780 --> 00:08:20,330
So anyway, there's a favor
that I'd like to ask you.

134
00:08:20,790 --> 00:08:22,790
Would you mind carrying
that for me?

135
00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:24,960
But...

136
00:08:27,170 --> 00:08:31,840
What do you have there?
It's kinda pretty.

137
00:08:49,690 --> 00:08:53,280
See, it works after all!
Over here!

138
00:08:57,450 --> 00:08:59,160
What, it responds
to male spirit?

139
00:08:59,240 --> 00:09:00,910
Fascinating...

140
00:09:01,490 --> 00:09:03,450
Keep your mitts off
of Simon, got it?

141
00:09:03,540 --> 00:09:06,080
How about you, then?

142
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:08,120
You die!

143
00:09:09,210 --> 00:09:12,250
Ladies don't care much for
men who can't take a joke.

144
00:09:14,130 --> 00:09:15,760
I'm really sorry about this.

145
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:20,640
Your village was damaged
because we screwed up,

146
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:22,470
...and now we're making you
carry stuff.

147
00:09:22,600 --> 00:09:26,690
It's because resources are scarce.
We have to use every scrap we find.

148
00:09:31,070 --> 00:09:32,070
What's wrong?

149
00:09:34,190 --> 00:09:35,190
What the hell is that?

150
00:09:35,280 --> 00:09:37,320
Someone who was killed
by Gunmen.

151
00:09:38,200 --> 00:09:40,620
Around here, it's not exactly
a rare occurrence.

152
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:44,330
That should do it.

153
00:09:44,410 --> 00:09:46,410
Yeah, we couldn't leave
his bones lying there.

154
00:09:47,370 --> 00:09:48,540
Pathetic.

155
00:09:49,040 --> 00:09:53,300
It's a waste of time to dig graves for
people who die out in this empty dump.

156
00:09:53,380 --> 00:09:56,510
Look, there's no telling when
we'll be the ones lying there.

157
00:09:56,590 --> 00:09:57,550
Never!

158
00:09:58,470 --> 00:10:02,010
Our journey will continue until we pierce
the heavens! As far as it takes!

159
00:10:03,100 --> 00:10:04,470
Huh?

160
00:10:05,310 --> 00:10:08,940
This place isn't the happy wonderland
you seem to think it is.

161
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:12,270
We ourselves don't
live here by choice.

162
00:10:12,570 --> 00:10:13,900
You don't?

163
00:10:16,650 --> 00:10:19,700
Our Littner was once an
underground village like yours.

164
00:10:20,030 --> 00:10:23,200
But there was an accident,
and it became uninhabitable.

165
00:10:23,490 --> 00:10:26,160
We had no choice but
to come to surface,

166
00:10:26,200 --> 00:10:28,580
...and when we did, those
Gunmen were waiting for us.

167
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:31,830
We have nowhere to return to,
so our only choice is to fight.

168
00:10:32,040 --> 00:10:36,000
Sounds nice! That's exactly the
sort of world I was looking for.

169
00:10:57,230 --> 00:11:01,780
It's no wonder they're exhausted.
It's been a day full of firsts for them.

170
00:11:05,450 --> 00:11:08,950
<font color=#FFC9B9>Gurren Lagann</font>

171
00:11:10,460 --> 00:11:13,960
<font color=#FFC9B9>Gurren Lagann</font>

172
00:11:15,130 --> 00:11:19,210
Look at that, kiddo! This is "up"!
This is the surface!

173
00:11:19,720 --> 00:11:21,130
There's nothing here...

174
00:11:21,260 --> 00:11:23,430
Nope, not a thing.

175
00:11:24,220 --> 00:11:25,510
That's why I like it.

176
00:11:25,810 --> 00:11:30,680
There are no walls and no ceiling.
This is truly a man's world.

177
00:11:31,640 --> 00:11:32,640
Ready to go?

178
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:37,480
I see...

179
00:11:45,030 --> 00:11:47,740
When you're ready,
come up and join me.

180
00:11:49,410 --> 00:11:53,330
Until then!
Goodbye for now, Kamina!

181
00:12:01,220 --> 00:12:02,420
What the hell?

182
00:12:04,550 --> 00:12:06,090
- C'mon, Simon!
- Hey, wait for me, Bro!

183
00:12:06,140 --> 00:12:09,010
- What was that?!
- What just happened?!

184
00:12:09,060 --> 00:12:10,140
Good morning.

185
00:12:10,350 --> 00:12:11,520
What the hell was that?!

186
00:12:11,560 --> 00:12:14,190
Mornings on the surface
start with Gunmen.

187
00:12:14,310 --> 00:12:15,980
Care for some morning coffee?

188
00:12:16,020 --> 00:12:18,270
What's that? Dirty water?

189
00:12:22,820 --> 00:12:24,200
Here comes another one.

190
00:12:29,330 --> 00:12:30,910
Ow, that's hot!

191
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:32,580
That's--

192
00:12:33,040 --> 00:12:35,250
Two days in a row,
that's pretty rough.

193
00:12:35,370 --> 00:12:39,380
There's usually a longer gap
between raids.

194
00:12:40,460 --> 00:12:42,170
Maybe this is payback
for yesterday.

195
00:12:42,670 --> 00:12:44,420
Whatever the reason,
we gotta fight 'em!

196
00:12:44,470 --> 00:12:47,510
Keep your opinions to yourself, please.
Can you use a gun?

197
00:12:47,760 --> 00:12:50,510
Don't look down on me, missy!
Who the hell do you think I am?

198
00:12:53,230 --> 00:12:53,730
Bro...

199
00:12:53,810 --> 00:12:55,980
Simon, you're in Lagann.

200
00:12:56,060 --> 00:13:00,020
No, you pilot it, Bro. I bet
you'd do a better job than--

201
00:13:00,570 --> 00:13:02,190
No, that thing belongs to you.

202
00:13:02,400 --> 00:13:04,110
But I'm not--

203
00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:06,360
We're counting on you!

204
00:13:06,450 --> 00:13:09,950
Don't let them get near the camp!
Split into two teams and hold them off!

205
00:13:10,410 --> 00:13:11,910
Come on, your place
is over here!

206
00:13:14,540 --> 00:13:15,250
This is--

207
00:13:15,370 --> 00:13:17,790
I was up all night polishing it.
What do we say?

208
00:13:17,830 --> 00:13:19,210
Um... Thank you.

209
00:13:19,250 --> 00:13:20,170
All right, hop in!

210
00:13:20,250 --> 00:13:22,670
Give the Spin On order
to your Core Drill.

211
00:13:22,920 --> 00:13:24,090
What's "Spin On"?

212
00:13:24,170 --> 00:13:27,340
When you screw it in!
Give it a hard, manly twist!

213
00:13:27,550 --> 00:13:28,720
O-Okay...

214
00:13:32,850 --> 00:13:33,680
Uh-oh.

215
00:13:33,810 --> 00:13:34,970
Problems again, dear?

216
00:13:35,890 --> 00:13:38,520
All right, you uppity
human filth!

217
00:13:38,690 --> 00:13:40,940
We're gonna take out
the trash this morning!

218
00:13:43,070 --> 00:13:44,650
Listen to 'em talk...

219
00:13:44,780 --> 00:13:46,150
Let's get started, people.

220
00:13:49,160 --> 00:13:51,200
- Another one's coming?
- Another?

221
00:13:51,490 --> 00:13:52,780
You might want to
cover your ears.

222
00:13:52,910 --> 00:13:55,500
One, two, one, two,
one, two...

223
00:13:56,620 --> 00:13:58,830
W-What the hell?

224
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:08,470
These tremors!

225
00:14:13,510 --> 00:14:16,640
One, two, one, two,
one, two...

226
00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:19,560
It was them!

227
00:14:20,770 --> 00:14:22,060
They caused them!

228
00:14:23,650 --> 00:14:26,230
All those earthquakes
were their fault!

229
00:14:29,070 --> 00:14:31,820
It's because of them that
my mom and dad are--

230
00:14:44,630 --> 00:14:45,710
That's a big one...

231
00:14:46,130 --> 00:14:47,710
I haven't seen
that one before.

232
00:14:48,170 --> 00:14:49,670
I like the face on that one.

233
00:15:01,350 --> 00:15:02,440
Now!

234
00:15:16,330 --> 00:15:17,410
What was that?

235
00:15:17,490 --> 00:15:20,000
We lined the top of the cliff
with explosives.

236
00:15:20,120 --> 00:15:22,120
That worked beautifully.

237
00:15:27,630 --> 00:15:28,880
Geez, those things
are tough!

238
00:15:28,960 --> 00:15:31,470
That's fine by me!
That thing is giving me chills!

239
00:15:32,430 --> 00:15:34,800
That settles it!
I'm gonna take that Gunmen!

240
00:15:35,850 --> 00:15:37,100
What in the world are
you talking about?

241
00:15:37,180 --> 00:15:39,270
I SAID, I'm gonna pilot
that thing!

242
00:15:39,560 --> 00:15:40,770
Hello? You listening?

243
00:15:40,940 --> 00:15:44,560
Those Beastmen or whatever
are piloting them now, right?

244
00:15:44,650 --> 00:15:46,650
There's no way in hell
that I can't do it, too!

245
00:15:46,730 --> 00:15:49,190
I have no idea where his
confidence comes from.

246
00:15:49,320 --> 00:15:52,110
Screw you! For a man, what matters
is deeds, not words!

247
00:15:52,240 --> 00:15:53,200
I'm a woman!

248
00:15:55,370 --> 00:15:56,370
Bro!

249
00:15:56,620 --> 00:15:58,580
You got here just in time,
blood brother!

250
00:16:01,160 --> 00:16:03,580
What is that guy thinking?

251
00:16:03,870 --> 00:16:05,500
Bro, it was them!

252
00:16:06,460 --> 00:16:10,090
The tremors they cause up here
end up as earthquakes down below!

253
00:16:10,170 --> 00:16:11,380
Oh, that's what they were!

254
00:16:11,510 --> 00:16:13,590
These guys killed
my mom and dad!

255
00:16:14,130 --> 00:16:17,430
Simon, I'm glad to see you worked up!
But don't be impatient.

256
00:16:17,640 --> 00:16:20,560
To win a fight, it's vital to have
burning passion, but a cool head!

257
00:16:21,140 --> 00:16:24,020
Listen up, I'm gonna help myself
to that pointy one.

258
00:16:24,850 --> 00:16:27,980
I'm betting that I can get inside
through the face in its belly.

259
00:16:28,070 --> 00:16:29,230
I need you to
force it open for me.

260
00:16:29,320 --> 00:16:31,280
But can you operate it?

261
00:16:31,530 --> 00:16:34,070
How did you know how
to operate Lagann?

262
00:16:34,150 --> 00:16:38,030
It's like the knowledge came flowing
into me when I grabbed these.

263
00:16:38,370 --> 00:16:39,620
That's what I'll do, then!

264
00:16:39,660 --> 00:16:41,370
It means that fighting spirit
is the important thing!

265
00:16:41,450 --> 00:16:42,660
Um, I think there might
be more than that...

266
00:16:42,710 --> 00:16:44,250
Whatever, just take us in!

267
00:16:44,330 --> 00:16:46,710
I'm not sensing
a cool head here!

268
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:03,140
S-Sorry!

269
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:07,150
Good grief, why do I have to keep
providing backup for that moron?

270
00:17:12,150 --> 00:17:13,860
Oopsie daisy!

271
00:17:14,530 --> 00:17:17,280
That body gives me chills
every time I look at it!

272
00:17:25,830 --> 00:17:26,660
What the--?

273
00:17:26,870 --> 00:17:28,670
Get off his head, human!

274
00:17:30,290 --> 00:17:31,250
Simon!

275
00:17:31,460 --> 00:17:33,630
You won't lay a hand
on my brother!

276
00:17:38,680 --> 00:17:40,640
Give me a minute, Bro!

277
00:17:43,060 --> 00:17:45,020
Get out, I'm taking over.

278
00:17:49,190 --> 00:17:51,360
Oh, yeah! It's all about
the fighting spirit!

279
00:18:00,740 --> 00:18:02,990
Commander Guzack
has been killed!

280
00:18:03,120 --> 00:18:05,540
Stinking humans!
You'll pay for this!

281
00:18:05,660 --> 00:18:09,040
I'm not dead yet,
you two idiots!

282
00:18:10,170 --> 00:18:12,590
How dare you kill
Squad Leader Guzack!

283
00:18:12,670 --> 00:18:15,050
This is for
the commander!

284
00:18:20,220 --> 00:18:21,840
Bro!

285
00:18:22,140 --> 00:18:25,930
I'm sending you to the afterlife,
too, pipsqueak!

286
00:18:38,530 --> 00:18:44,870
Crap, what's slowing you down, Kamina?
Let's see some more spirit!

287
00:19:20,490 --> 00:19:23,110
Don't screw with me,
you Gunmen bastards!

288
00:19:24,700 --> 00:19:28,700
Who the hell do you
think I am?!

289
00:19:30,660 --> 00:19:33,080
It's all over for you, runt!

290
00:19:33,250 --> 00:19:36,540
"Who The Hell Do You
Think I Am" Kick!

291
00:19:38,840 --> 00:19:41,670
"Hands Off My Beloved
Little Brother" Punch!

292
00:19:52,060 --> 00:19:54,150
Simon!
Pull it together, Simon!

293
00:19:56,150 --> 00:19:57,190
B-Bro...?

294
00:19:57,270 --> 00:19:59,690
Sorry 'bout that. Got a little
held up back there.

295
00:19:59,940 --> 00:20:01,400
Let's take 'em down together!

296
00:20:02,860 --> 00:20:03,860
Wait, what?

297
00:20:04,360 --> 00:20:07,700
You deliver the final blow!
Put some backbone into it, Simon!

298
00:20:07,990 --> 00:20:09,870
Chew on this!
Finishing move!

299
00:20:09,950 --> 00:20:14,210
Perfect Combustion of Manly Souls!
Cannonball Attack!

300
00:20:14,250 --> 00:20:16,880
This is so messed up!

301
00:20:24,340 --> 00:20:26,390
Ha! You missed!

302
00:20:26,550 --> 00:20:28,260
Oh? Did we?

303
00:20:30,470 --> 00:20:33,180
I guess I have to do it!

304
00:20:35,810 --> 00:20:37,400
Neener neen--

305
00:20:42,070 --> 00:20:44,240
T-They've all
been destroyed!

306
00:20:47,450 --> 00:20:49,160
Talk about overkill...

307
00:20:49,490 --> 00:20:51,580
But you have to admit,
it was pretty cool.

308
00:20:51,790 --> 00:20:53,330
You have a weakness
for his type, huh?

309
00:20:53,500 --> 00:20:55,290
How long have you been
standing there?

310
00:20:55,960 --> 00:20:57,540
I must admit, I'm surprised.

311
00:20:57,580 --> 00:21:01,500
Hijacking a Gunmen isn't something
that ever occurred to us.

312
00:21:01,840 --> 00:21:05,380
Those two certainly are amusing.

313
00:21:05,510 --> 00:21:07,840
Give me a break, Bro...

314
00:21:11,600 --> 00:21:14,810
I've decided.
I'm naming this Gurren.

315
00:21:15,190 --> 00:21:19,860
No matter how unforgiving this place
may be, we'll fight our way through!

316
00:21:20,360 --> 00:21:22,280
Me in my Gurren,
and you in your Lagann!

317
00:21:23,150 --> 00:21:25,190
Wait for me, Dad...

318
00:21:36,670 --> 00:21:39,670
Sorry, I didn't mean to wake
you up from your sleep.

319
00:21:40,880 --> 00:21:45,920
I guess I got a little wild this afternoon,
but don't hold it against me, okay?

320
00:21:53,390 --> 00:21:55,770
No way...
It can't be!

321
00:21:56,940 --> 00:21:59,350
It isn't possible!

322
00:22:12,080 --> 00:22:13,080
Dad...

323
00:22:16,660 --> 00:22:18,910
You bought it out here?

324
00:22:22,040 --> 00:22:26,010
You didn't wait...
You died too soon...

325
00:22:27,800 --> 00:22:32,510
Dad!

326
00:22:30,970 --> 00:22:34,930
To Be Continued...

327
00:22:42,250 --> 00:22:48,480
<font color=#FFFF00>Hikari wo motomete kage ha tawainai jooku wo shaberu
</font>'Cuz they seek light, the shadows chatter out grade-school jokes

328
00:22:48,480 --> 00:22:54,460
<font color=#FFFF00>Kikitai no ha sonna koto ja nai
</font>I don't want to listen to that crap

329
00:23:00,930 --> 00:23:06,990
<font color=#FFFF00>Taiyou motomete kage ha tamashii no nuketa koe kara
</font>'Cuz they seek the sun, the shadows suddenly change from

330
00:23:06,990 --> 00:23:12,870
<font color=#FFFF00>Kyuu ni surudoi kuchou ni kawaru
</font>The soul's missing voice to a sharp tone of voice

331
00:23:13,030 --> 00:23:19,580
<font color=#FFFF00>Sono oto ga machi no naka ni kodama-shite hibikinagara
</font>While that sound echoed and bounced in the middle of town,

332
00:23:19,580 --> 00:23:25,620
<font color=#FFFF00>Kemono no you na koe de sakebitsudzuketa
</font>I kept on screaming in a beastly voice

333
00:23:25,660 --> 00:23:28,890
<font color=#FFFF00>Kidou wo kaeta tsumori ha nai
</font>No way I'm going to change my course

334
00:23:28,890 --> 00:23:32,090

</font>The reverb's dazzling, but
