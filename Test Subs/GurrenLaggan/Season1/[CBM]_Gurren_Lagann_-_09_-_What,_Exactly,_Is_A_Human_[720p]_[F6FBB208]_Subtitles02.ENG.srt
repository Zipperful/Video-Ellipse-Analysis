00:00:32,030 --> 00:00:36,570
<font color=#FFFF00>Konna kimochi mo muda de ha nai
</font>Then these kinds of feelings aren't futile

6
00:00:36,910 --> 00:00:42,610
<font color=#FFFF00>Akogare ni oshitsubusarete akirametetanda
</font>I was crushed by my longing and had given up

7
00:00:42,910 --> 00:00:47,870
<font color=#FFFF00>Hateshinai sora no iro mo shiranaide
</font>Without even knowing the color of the endless sky

8
00:00:48,280 --> 00:00:53,190
<font color=#FFFF00>Hashiridashita omoi ga ima demo
</font>I began to run, because my feelings, even now,

9
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:58,960
<font color=#FFFF00>Kono mune wo tashika ni tataiteru kara
</font>Are definitely beating against my heart

13
00:01:31,290 --> 00:01:35,670
This is the tale of a man who continues
to fight against fate.

14
00:01:36,550 --> 00:01:41,390
This man lived a life of desire,
loyalty, and extravagance,

15
00:01:41,850 --> 00:01:44,930
...he loved his companions,
and he strove for freedom.

16
00:01:45,060 --> 00:01:48,020
And then, abruptly, he died.

17
00:01:49,230 --> 00:01:51,520
But even so, Simon lives on.

18
00:01:52,230 --> 00:01:54,270
He must go on living.

Thymilph has died, has he?

22
00:02:07,830 --> 00:02:11,210
Yes, Majesty. Reports also say
that Dai-Gunzan was stolen.

...will turn and fight when cornered.

31
00:02:26,600 --> 00:02:31,150
If a lowly armadillo did turn and fight,
all one need do is crush it.

32
00:02:31,400 --> 00:02:35,150
You don't understand the finer
subtleties of this world, I see.

33
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:38,320
You forget that we are in the
presence of the Spiral King.

34
00:02:38,440 --> 00:02:39,240
Spiral King.

35
00:02:39,320 --> 00:02:43,160
I ask that the honor of retaking Dai-Gunzan
be given to me, Cytomander, the Swift.

36
00:02:43,240 --> 00:02:46,410
No, that mission
must surely go to me.

37
00:02:46,580 --> 00:02:49,040
Thymilph was a dear friend to me.

38
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:53,330
Grant me the opportunity to
avenge his death, Spiral King.

39
00:02:54,590 --> 00:02:56,340
A dear friend, eh?

40
00:02:56,460 --> 00:03:00,800
Indeed. There is such a thing as
friendship that knows no gender.

41
00:03:01,010 --> 00:03:04,720
In other words, he was useful
to your ends.

42
00:03:04,760 --> 00:03:06,260
Hold your tongue, anteater.

43
00:03:06,930 --> 00:03:09,470
I created you,
yet you suggest...

44
00:03:09,560 --> 00:03:12,980
...that you know a friendship
that I am unaware of?

45
00:03:13,520 --> 00:03:16,320
As you wish.
Go, Adiane.

46
00:03:16,650 --> 00:03:18,150
Thank you, Sire.

47
00:03:18,320 --> 00:03:21,450
Adiane, the Elegant, shall give
these humans a lesson...

48
00:03:21,530 --> 00:03:24,410
...in the power and terror
of the Spiral King.

49
00:03:27,910 --> 00:03:30,540
You do not approve, Cytomander?

50
00:03:31,160 --> 00:03:34,250
Spiral King, you are the immortal
creator of this world,

51
00:03:34,380 --> 00:03:36,630
...and the monarch who rules
over all within it.

52
00:03:36,790 --> 00:03:40,340
I haven't the slightest intention
of defying your decisions.

53
00:03:40,510 --> 00:03:41,880
In that case, leave me.

54
00:03:42,010 --> 00:03:43,010
Yes, Sire.

00:03:50,810 --> 00:03:56,020
They seek out the light, even
though only death awaits them.

57
00:03:56,690 --> 00:03:58,820
It is enough to
make me despair...

58
00:03:59,780 --> 00:04:03,570
...at the nature of these
creatures called humans.

59
00:04:12,960 --> 00:04:14,830
Okay, let's end this!

60
00:04:14,870 --> 00:04:16,670
- Back off.
- What?

61
00:04:16,830 --> 00:04:17,920

00:05:05,130 --> 00:05:06,590
It's been seven days now.

65
00:05:12,640 --> 00:05:14,470
I still can't believe it.

66
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:18,480
Yeah...

67
00:05:23,530 --> 00:05:24,320
What's wrong?

68
00:05:24,440 --> 00:05:28,160
There's not enough engine output.
It refuses to stabilize.

69
00:05:34,750 --> 00:05:36,660
That hurt!

70
00:05:39,210 --> 00:05:40,380
Are you all right?

71
00:05:40,460 --> 00:05:43,090
I'm fine, I'm fine.
That was a good hit, Rossiu.

72
00:05:43,170 --> 00:05:46,510
I'm really sorry! I can't seem to get
the hang of power distribution.

73
00:05:46,590 --> 00:05:48,340
That was impressive, Rossiu!

74
00:05:48,430 --> 00:05:50,970
Dayakka? Leeron?

75
00:05:51,140 --> 00:05:53,010
Are you going to the
engine room again?

76
00:05:53,140 --> 00:05:57,270
Dai-Gurren here is a
temperamental fellow.

77
00:05:57,890 --> 00:05:59,900
Dai-Gurren, huh?

78
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:03,570
Yoko insisted that we
give it that name.

79
00:06:03,650 --> 00:06:04,690
I see.

80
00:06:04,860 --> 00:06:08,950
It has a repair factory, and its living
quarters are fully equipped.

81
00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:12,450
Now, if only we could get the
main engine stabilized...

82
00:06:12,740 --> 00:06:16,410
Even Gurren is as good as new
after that pounding it took.

83
00:06:16,580 --> 00:06:18,790
It's one hell of a facility,
that's for sure.

84
00:06:18,920 --> 00:06:21,380
Simon, get your act together!

85
00:06:22,380 --> 00:06:25,960
The only thing it can't mend
is a broken human heart.

86
00:06:26,260 --> 00:06:30,680
You're not the only one aboard, you know!
Gurren Lagann is all about teamwork!

87
00:06:30,760 --> 00:06:33,510
Nobody asked you to pilot it.

88
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:36,970
Say what? So, you're saying that you
can pilot it all by yourself?

89
00:06:38,020 --> 00:06:39,680
I'll do it by myself.

90
00:06:39,770 --> 00:06:41,900
That's a good idea.
Actually, that's for the best.

91
00:06:42,060 --> 00:06:44,560
Don't get too full
of yourself, kid!

92
00:06:44,610 --> 00:06:48,820
If you'd have held it together,
Kamina wouldn't be dead now!

93
00:06:48,900 --> 00:06:50,360
Big brother!

94
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:55,830
I'm sorry, Simon.

95
00:06:57,040 --> 00:06:59,500
It's okay.
What Kittan said is true.

96
00:06:59,710 --> 00:07:01,210
I killed Kamina.

97
00:07:01,710 --> 00:07:05,590
So I'll get tougher.
I HAVE to get tough.

98
00:07:06,130 --> 00:07:08,880
I'll fight hard enough
for both me AND Kamina.

99
00:07:12,260 --> 00:07:16,050
Rossiu, why didn't that god of yours
save Kamina?

100
00:07:16,180 --> 00:07:20,310
That's right, I forgot. The god
you pray to is a Gunmen.

101
00:07:20,600 --> 00:07:25,560
No wonder he died. After all,
it was a god that killed him!

102
00:07:25,650 --> 00:07:27,150
Simon.

103
00:07:31,070 --> 00:07:33,610
I'm sorry.
That was uncalled for.

104
00:07:46,040 --> 00:07:49,130
Sorry, Boota.
I'm exhausted.

105
00:07:52,220 --> 00:07:53,430
Bro...

106
00:08:00,640 --> 00:08:03,270
It's gotta be Kittan or nobody.

107
00:08:03,940 --> 00:08:08,110
Yeah, he's the one who called us
all together in the first place.

108
00:08:08,190 --> 00:08:11,610
Simon's just too unreliable.
He's too damn mopey.

109
00:08:11,690 --> 00:08:14,280
Just because he can pilot Lagann
doesn't mean he should be leader.

110
00:08:14,410 --> 00:08:19,580
If an obnoxious kid like him is made
leader, Team Gurren is history.

111
00:08:20,450 --> 00:08:21,950
DAI-Gurren.

112
00:08:22,410 --> 00:08:25,420
It's not Team Gurren.
It's Team DAI-Gurren now!

113
00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:31,130
Don't eat yourself sick.

114
00:08:31,260 --> 00:08:35,590
I need to keep up my energy. I can't
even use a rifle properly, remember?

115
00:08:36,260 --> 00:08:40,680
The Four Generals, the Spiral King,
we've still got lots of enemies out there.

116
00:08:41,180 --> 00:08:42,930
The war goes on.

117
00:08:43,060 --> 00:08:45,190
Yeah, you have a point.

118
00:08:48,150 --> 00:08:49,980
So does this rain...

119
00:08:50,610 --> 00:08:55,400
Even with the rain, I can have a hot meal
right after target practice now.

120
00:08:56,030 --> 00:08:58,820
Seven days ago, I never
would have imagined it.

121
00:08:59,910 --> 00:09:01,740
And it's all thanks to him.

122
00:09:03,790 --> 00:09:06,330
Look, about Simon...

123
00:09:06,790 --> 00:09:09,210
He seems like he's
getting worn down.

124
00:09:09,670 --> 00:09:10,710
Oh.

125
00:09:10,840 --> 00:09:12,590
Aren't you worried
about him?

126
00:09:15,090 --> 00:09:19,760
Keda. Kaia.
Mycee. Nashika.

127
00:09:19,890 --> 00:09:23,310
We sure lost a lot of people
defending Littner, didn't we?

128
00:09:23,430 --> 00:09:24,470
Yeah.

129
00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:26,810
Sacrifices are necessary
for survival.

130
00:09:26,940 --> 00:09:29,810
And we survivors work even harder
to make sure they weren't in vain.

131
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:33,070
I've always accepted that
as part of what we do.

132
00:09:33,150 --> 00:09:36,400
But this time,
I don't think I can.

133
00:09:38,990 --> 00:09:42,740
I'm sorry, it's all I can do
to keep myself together.

134
00:09:51,250 --> 00:09:53,590
You said you'd repay that kiss
ten times over.

135
00:09:53,670 --> 00:09:58,010
What's the big idea, leaving a hole
in my heart that's ten times bigger?

136
00:09:58,300 --> 00:09:59,970
Kamina, you jerk...

137
00:10:06,390 --> 00:10:09,730
Gunmen detected! They're closing in
from off the starboard bow!

138
00:10:09,900 --> 00:10:11,690
I despise persistent types...

139
00:10:11,900 --> 00:10:12,900
Leeron!

140
00:10:13,150 --> 00:10:17,150
I'll combine Lagann with Gurren and
head out. I'll be fine on my own.

141
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:18,990
I'll pilot Gurren.

142
00:10:19,240 --> 00:10:20,110
Rossiu?

143
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:24,080
I mean, you can't do it by yourself, right?
Go on, combine.

144
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:26,490
Yeah, all right...

145
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:40,050
Simon!
This is overkill!

146
00:10:40,380 --> 00:10:43,050
He who strikes first wins!
It's what Kamina would have done!

147
00:10:48,310 --> 00:10:49,930
Power output is unstable!

148
00:10:55,360 --> 00:10:58,230
Bastard! Bastard! Bastard!
Bastard! Bastard! Bast--

149
00:11:02,620 --> 00:11:06,620
Keep it together!
Kamina never screamed, not once!

150
00:11:08,540 --> 00:11:10,210
Simon, you have to calm down!

151
00:11:10,540 --> 00:11:13,960
If you keep fighting like this,
YOU will die this time!

152
00:11:14,170 --> 00:11:15,920
Kamina wouldn't run away!

153
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:19,460
Not Kamina! Not ever!

154
00:11:47,080 --> 00:11:48,950
What's wrong, Simon?

155
00:11:54,960 --> 00:11:57,380
The energy is feeding back?

156
00:11:59,300 --> 00:12:00,800
T-The drill!

157
00:12:08,390 --> 00:12:11,470
Come back here, damn you!

158
00:12:14,730 --> 00:12:16,400
Rossiu!
Are you all right?

159
00:12:16,520 --> 00:12:17,900
What happened, Rossiu?

160
00:12:17,980 --> 00:12:20,650
Lagann suddenly separated,
and then it--

161
00:12:20,740 --> 00:12:21,740
It fell down this?

162
00:12:21,820 --> 00:12:24,650
He abandoned you and ran
in the face of the enemy?

163
00:12:24,740 --> 00:12:27,240
It seemed like Lagann
had gone berserk.

164
00:12:27,830 --> 00:12:30,240
Gone berserk?
Seriously?

165
00:12:30,330 --> 00:12:31,540
I think.

166
00:12:31,950 --> 00:12:33,410
Simon...

168
00:12:43,510 --> 00:12:47,010
<font color=#FFC9B9>Gurren Lagann</font>

169
00:13:00,900 --> 00:13:03,530
Why did the controls
stop responding?

170
00:13:05,650 --> 00:13:07,110
It started!

171
00:14:56,270 --> 00:14:57,560
Hail fellow well met!

172
00:14:57,600 --> 00:15:00,020
H-Hail fellow...?

173
00:15:00,440 --> 00:15:02,400
Who are you, good sir?

174
00:15:02,690 --> 00:15:06,150
"Good sir"? Um, I'm nobody important
enough to be called that.

175
00:15:06,570 --> 00:15:09,240
Oh! This is the outside,
isn't it?

176
00:15:09,650 --> 00:15:11,200
This is rain!

177
00:15:17,620 --> 00:15:19,870
It is cold.
What is this?

178
00:15:20,210 --> 00:15:24,000
Um, that's dirt.
Are you okay without any shoes?

179
00:15:24,460 --> 00:15:29,760
It's cold and wet and squishy...
It feels wonderful!

180
00:15:29,920 --> 00:15:31,630
Really? It does?

181
00:15:35,970 --> 00:15:38,850
Why are you the same as I am?

182
00:15:39,770 --> 00:15:42,980
You have no tail,
nor fangs or scales.

183
00:15:43,190 --> 00:15:45,440
Your skin is soft, as well.

184
00:15:45,610 --> 00:15:48,780
Well, that's only natural.
I'm a human being.

185
00:15:48,980 --> 00:15:50,030
"Human being"?

186
00:15:50,110 --> 00:15:52,900
Right. A human being.
A human. A person.

187
00:15:54,950 --> 00:15:57,580
And what, exactly,
is a human?

188
00:15:58,540 --> 00:16:02,750
Huh? Well, a human is...
Well, like you and me.

189
00:16:02,870 --> 00:16:05,210
We look like this, we have
a head, stuff like that.

190
00:16:05,630 --> 00:16:07,170
There are others like us?

191
00:16:07,880 --> 00:16:10,380
Sure. There are more.

192
00:16:10,550 --> 00:16:14,720
Really? And all of them
are the same as you?

193
00:16:14,800 --> 00:16:16,510
They have the same face?

194
00:16:16,600 --> 00:16:20,560
No, we're not all identical. It would be
creepy if everyone had the same face.

195
00:16:20,890 --> 00:16:23,020
It would?

196
00:16:23,850 --> 00:16:27,060
Oh, the rain has stopped!

197
00:16:27,770 --> 00:16:29,690
Hey, you're right.

198
00:16:34,780 --> 00:16:38,240
I wonder why I am outside?

199
00:16:38,830 --> 00:16:41,240
Um, I don't really know.

200
00:16:41,870 --> 00:16:43,750
First things first, though,
we need to get out of here.

201
00:16:44,080 --> 00:16:45,290
Here.

202
00:16:45,540 --> 00:16:48,250
You can't walk like that.
Here, put these on.

203
00:16:48,500 --> 00:16:49,670
All right.

204
00:16:53,090 --> 00:16:55,470
My name is Nia.
What is yours?

205
00:16:55,550 --> 00:16:58,430
Who, me?
I'm Simon.

206
00:16:58,640 --> 00:17:01,510
Simon...
What a fine name.

207
00:17:03,520 --> 00:17:04,680
Thanks.

208
00:17:04,940 --> 00:17:06,100
Tell me, Simon.

209
00:17:06,440 --> 00:17:07,230
What?

210
00:17:07,520 --> 00:17:09,020
What is that?

211
00:17:12,280 --> 00:17:13,780
Hurry! This way!

212
00:17:17,410 --> 00:17:18,700
Simon, what is that?

213
00:17:18,780 --> 00:17:22,700
It's a Gunmen! Humans on the surface
are at war against them!

214
00:17:22,790 --> 00:17:23,660
At war?

215
00:17:23,750 --> 00:17:25,540
If we don't fight them,
they'll kill us!

216
00:17:26,120 --> 00:17:27,670
Please, Lagann!

217
00:17:29,380 --> 00:17:30,540
It worked!

218
00:17:48,980 --> 00:17:50,940
Simon, are you all right?

219
00:17:51,070 --> 00:17:52,980
Damn it, not again!

220
00:17:53,150 --> 00:17:57,990
Why? Why won't you do
as I tell you, Lagann?!

221
00:18:03,120 --> 00:18:04,290
Run, Nia!

222
00:18:05,370 --> 00:18:08,120
Once you start, keep running
and don't look back.

223
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:10,790
I'll keep the Gunmen
busy here.

224
00:18:11,210 --> 00:18:12,090
But you--

225
00:18:12,130 --> 00:18:15,050
I'm sick of it! I'm sick
of watching people die!

226
00:18:15,420 --> 00:18:19,470
I don't care what happens to me,
just so long as no one else dies!

227
00:18:26,770 --> 00:18:28,980
Do you really want to die?

228
00:18:29,520 --> 00:18:33,230
If you are frightened, you should run.
You mustn't die.

229
00:18:33,360 --> 00:18:35,270
No, I'm not scared.

230
00:18:35,360 --> 00:18:36,860
You mustn't lie, either.

231
00:18:38,780 --> 00:18:40,860
Come, let's escape.
Together.

232
00:18:50,960 --> 00:18:54,170
I'm not gonna let anyone else die!

233
00:18:56,760 --> 00:18:58,590
I'm here, too!

234
00:19:00,010 --> 00:19:03,050
Kittan Stinger!

235
00:19:03,930 --> 00:19:08,560
Hell's Headsplitter!!

236
00:19:10,060 --> 00:19:11,940
I finally got a chance to use it!

237
00:19:25,280 --> 00:19:28,160
First he deserts, and now he's
got a woman on his arm?

238
00:19:29,580 --> 00:19:31,460
Some are slender,
some are fat,

239
00:19:31,540 --> 00:19:33,960
...some are rounded,
and some are angular.

240
00:19:34,290 --> 00:19:36,750
Human beings certainly come in all
shapes and sizes, don't they?

241
00:19:36,880 --> 00:19:40,130
So you've never seen another
human being before, have you?

242
00:19:40,470 --> 00:19:42,760
No. Only my honorable father.

243
00:19:42,840 --> 00:19:44,430
Honorable father, she says...

244
00:19:44,550 --> 00:19:45,680
Thank you.

245
00:19:46,050 --> 00:19:47,640
What's Old Coco doing here?

246
00:19:48,140 --> 00:19:49,060
It's delicious!

247
00:19:49,180 --> 00:19:51,980
So when you woke up, you'd been
locked in that container...

248
00:19:52,060 --> 00:19:54,150
...and thrown into that gorge
for some reason?

249
00:19:54,230 --> 00:19:55,150
Yes.

250
00:19:55,230 --> 00:19:58,610
Do you remember any details
about where your village is?

251
00:19:59,570 --> 00:20:00,280
Village?

252
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:01,940
Where your house is.

253
00:20:02,030 --> 00:20:05,200
I have no idea.
I've never been outside before.

254
00:20:05,280 --> 00:20:08,700
Father always said that
the outside world was dangerous.

255
00:20:08,830 --> 00:20:13,290
Well, he was right about that.
I bet your father is worried about you.

256
00:20:13,750 --> 00:20:15,210
I'm not so sure.

257
00:20:15,500 --> 00:20:19,800
Well, I believe I may
have angered him.

258
00:20:19,920 --> 00:20:20,880
Why's that?

259
00:20:20,960 --> 00:20:25,680
I asked him a question.
"Why was I born?" I asked.

260
00:20:26,050 --> 00:20:30,310
As soon as I said it,
Father closed his heart to me.

261
00:20:31,560 --> 00:20:32,730
I don't get it.

262
00:20:32,850 --> 00:20:35,770
Your father sounds like
an odd man.

263
00:20:41,690 --> 00:20:47,280
Lagann... Are you going
to abandon me, too?

264
00:20:50,370 --> 00:20:53,160
What the hell do you
want me to do, damn it?!

265
00:20:53,620 --> 00:20:56,370
Can't I even avenge
Kamina's death?!

266
00:20:58,790 --> 00:20:59,840
Yoko.

267
00:20:59,920 --> 00:21:03,460
Don't do it. Nothing you say
can help him right now.

268
00:21:03,550 --> 00:21:06,680
You'll only make the hole
in his heart bigger.

269
00:21:09,430 --> 00:21:10,600
What happened?!

270
00:21:13,730 --> 00:21:14,890
What's going on?

271
00:21:16,560 --> 00:21:18,270
Where's this water coming from?!

272
00:21:18,520 --> 00:21:20,940
Wait a minute, something's coming!

273
00:21:21,020 --> 00:21:22,190
What is it?

274
00:21:22,320 --> 00:21:23,440
It's huge...

275
00:21:23,570 --> 00:21:26,740
Simon! Where's Simon?!
Where's Gurren Lagann?

276
00:21:38,750 --> 00:21:41,750
There's no escape, human scum.

277
00:21:42,210 --> 00:21:43,340
I know that voice...

278
00:21:43,420 --> 00:21:45,050
Fire main cannon!

279
00:21:45,130 --> 00:21:47,050
They're still being calibrated!

280
00:21:49,640 --> 00:21:50,390
Rossiu!

281
00:21:50,470 --> 00:21:52,220
I know!
I'll go out in Gurren!

282
00:22:00,060 --> 00:22:01,060
Nia?

283
00:22:03,860 --> 00:22:05,820
Wha--? That idiot, is she trying
to get herself killed?

284
00:22:10,320 --> 00:22:11,950
Stop this, Adiane!

285
00:22:13,660 --> 00:22:14,740
What?

286
00:22:14,830 --> 00:22:16,370
Wait, is that--?

287
00:22:16,710 --> 00:22:20,000
First Princess Nia, daughter of
Spiral King Lordgenome, orders you!

288
00:22:20,080 --> 00:22:22,340
Leave us, Adiane, the Elegant!

289
00:22:22,540 --> 00:22:24,550
Are you aware of who I am?

<b>Next Time</b>

303
00:24:06,480 --> 00:24:10,650
Precious memories...
Do they tie people down?

304
00:24:10,900 --> 00:24:13,570
Or are they what saves them?

305
00:24:13,990 --> 00:24:16,070
Next time on Gurren Lagann,

307
00:24:16,740 --> 00:24:19,580
