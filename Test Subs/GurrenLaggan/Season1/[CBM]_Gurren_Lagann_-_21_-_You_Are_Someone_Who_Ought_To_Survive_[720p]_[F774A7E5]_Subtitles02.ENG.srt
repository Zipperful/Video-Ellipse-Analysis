00:00:10,670 --> 00:00:15,470
Gurren Lagann

2
00:00:15,470 --> 00:00:20,780
<font color=#FFFF00>Sugita kisetsu wo nageku hima ha nai
</font>I don't have the time to lament the seasons that have passed

3
00:00:20,780 --> 00:00:26,350
<font color=#FFFF00>Nido to mayotte shimawanu you ni
</font>So that I won't ever waver again

4
00:00:26,350 --> 00:00:31,660
<font color=#FFFF00>Kazoekirenai hon no sasayaka na
</font>With countless, tiny little

5
00:00:31,660 --> 00:00:36,560
<font color=#FFFF00>Sonna koukai kakaeta mama
</font>Regrets carried in my arms

6
00:00:36,660 --> 00:00:42,640
<font color=#FFFF00>Sono senaka dake oikakete koko made kitanda
</font>I've come this far, having chased only after your back

7
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:48,040
<font color=#FFFF00>Sagashite ita boku dake ni dekiru koto
</font>It's something only I, who sought you, can do

8
00:00:48,100 --> 00:00:53,110
<font color=#FFFF00>Ano hi kureta kotoba ga ima demo
</font>Those words you gave me that day, even now,

9
00:00:53,200 --> 00:00:58,940
<font color=#FFFF00>Kono mune ni tashika ni todoite iru kara
</font>Definitely reach my heart

10
00:00:59,050 --> 00:01:04,210
<font color=#FFFF00>Kinou yori mo kyou ha bu ha boku no
</font>I've realized my reason for having been born

11
00:01:04,250 --> 00:01:09,960
<font color=#FFFF00>Umarete kita wake ni kidzuite yuku
</font>Today more than I did yesterday

12
00:01:10,100 --> 00:01:18,830
<font color=#FFFF00>Kotae ha sou itsumo koko ni aru
</font>The answer, yes, is always right here

13
00:01:33,880 --> 00:01:38,090
This is the tale of a man who continues
to look for his own path,

14
00:01:38,180 --> 00:01:41,140
...even while he is being
betrayed by fate.

15
00:01:41,760 --> 00:01:45,390
Simon is thrown into prison
as a war criminal.

16
00:01:46,020 --> 00:01:49,650
What he finds waiting for him there
is Viral, his former enemy.

17
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:54,320
Elsewhere, Rossiu is informed
that the moon's impact...

18
00:01:54,440 --> 00:01:56,820
...will deal a fatal blow
to the Earth.

19
00:01:57,490 --> 00:02:03,030
Amidst the battle, the Arc-Gurren abandons
a great many people as it lifts off.

20
00:02:03,660 --> 00:02:08,370
But Nia, who has become the Anti-Spiral's
messenger, says the following:

21
00:02:10,330 --> 00:02:14,590
Even if they do escape into space,
all that awaits them there is despair.

22
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:15,880
What?

23
00:02:15,960 --> 00:02:20,840
I don't see you for a while, and you
go and turn into a boring bitch...

24
00:02:21,390 --> 00:02:23,100
...Nia.

25
00:02:26,980 --> 00:02:31,150
Surrender to the inevitable.
Humanity has no future.

26
00:02:31,770 --> 00:02:33,270
Hey, wait!

27
00:02:36,900 --> 00:02:38,360
How many were we able
to bring aboard?

28
00:02:38,440 --> 00:02:41,610
We have confirmation
of 176,800 people.

29
00:02:41,700 --> 00:02:43,320
Less than half of what
we'd planned...

30
00:02:43,410 --> 00:02:45,990
Enemies detected!
Two Mugann! Huge ones!

31
00:02:46,490 --> 00:02:47,870
No!

32
00:02:50,540 --> 00:02:53,830
This was a trap all along?

33
00:02:54,920 --> 00:03:00,670
<b>Episode 21:
You Are Someone Who Ought To Survive</b>

34
00:03:00,930 --> 00:03:03,140
<b>One Year Earlier</b>

35
00:03:22,030 --> 00:03:25,490
- Give it back!
- If you don't like it, take it back!

36
00:03:25,990 --> 00:03:27,990
You're such a baby, Nakim!

37
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:35,580
- Let's go!
- We're late, we're late!

38
00:03:39,510 --> 00:03:43,380
You're hopeless, Nakim.
C'mon, get up.

39
00:03:43,510 --> 00:03:44,720
Wait.

40
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:52,940
You can get up
by yourself, right?

41
00:03:57,150 --> 00:03:59,320
That's better, young man.

42
00:04:09,660 --> 00:04:13,750
I'd like to introduce your
new teacher to you.

43
00:04:14,500 --> 00:04:15,960
I hear she's from the mainland!

44
00:04:16,040 --> 00:04:17,330
She's a babe!

45
00:04:17,460 --> 00:04:19,960
Really? I don't think
she's all that pretty.

46
00:04:20,920 --> 00:04:22,970
She's our teacher...

47
00:04:23,090 --> 00:04:26,970
I'm Yomako. I hope we all
become good friends.

48
00:04:30,010 --> 00:04:32,930
I'm terribly sorry about
all the junk in here.

49
00:04:33,430 --> 00:04:37,400
It used to be a night guard hut,
so at least it's livable.

50
00:04:37,650 --> 00:04:39,150
Thank you for everything.

51
00:04:39,230 --> 00:04:42,610
We call this a school,
but I'm the only staffer,

52
00:04:42,820 --> 00:04:46,320
...so it's a big relief to have
some new blood hereabouts.

53
00:04:46,700 --> 00:04:48,070
I see.

54
00:04:48,410 --> 00:04:53,700
Still, why would someone as famous as you
want to come to our little island?

55
00:04:56,120 --> 00:04:58,790
Are you sure that you don't have
me mistaken for someone else?

56
00:04:59,170 --> 00:05:02,130
I'm just Yomako, an ordinary
new teacher.

57
00:05:02,260 --> 00:05:05,420
Yes, yes, of course.
We old-timers tend to blurt things out.

58
00:05:05,800 --> 00:05:07,680
'Bye, Teach!

59
00:05:07,890 --> 00:05:09,140
Goodbye!

60
00:05:10,760 --> 00:05:15,060
Those children are the first
to be born on the surface.

61
00:05:15,690 --> 00:05:18,400
I want to make sure that someone
watches over them.

62
00:05:19,310 --> 00:05:26,240
Yes, I don't want them to have
a life without the sky.

63
00:05:29,990 --> 00:05:30,870
What?

64
00:05:30,990 --> 00:05:32,030
Let me have a look!

65
00:05:32,200 --> 00:05:33,740
Forget it!

66
00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:44,460
Here we go!

67
00:05:45,470 --> 00:05:47,880
One, two, three, four!

68
00:05:50,430 --> 00:05:52,260
Quit being so fussy!

69
00:06:01,560 --> 00:06:04,780
Miss Yomako!

70
00:06:07,450 --> 00:06:11,410
Until six years ago, human beings
lived their whole lives underground.

71
00:06:11,700 --> 00:06:15,660
The two who set us all free
were Kamina... and Simon.

72
00:06:16,290 --> 00:06:18,870
The two great heroes.

73
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,620
Hey, that's--

74
00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:22,130
This is the Teach!

75
00:06:22,210 --> 00:06:24,210
Come on, that's not--

76
00:06:28,050 --> 00:06:31,010
No chatting in class.
You know that.

77
00:06:33,220 --> 00:06:35,470
How come I'm being
punished, too?

78
00:06:39,850 --> 00:06:41,190
Good morning!

79
00:06:43,060 --> 00:06:44,150
Good morning, every--

80
00:06:48,150 --> 00:06:52,530
Just ignore it. If you let them get to you,
it'll just make it worse.

81
00:06:56,240 --> 00:06:59,540
This is a lie!
A big, fat lie!

82
00:07:08,760 --> 00:07:11,340
My bag! Who the heck
put it up there?!

83
00:07:11,510 --> 00:07:13,930
Quit your bawling!
It's just a stupid bag!

84
00:07:15,180 --> 00:07:19,640
I got that bag from my late dad!
It's all I have to remember him by!

85
00:07:21,690 --> 00:07:23,600
Go get it yourself!

86
00:07:23,730 --> 00:07:25,060
No, don't!
I'll get it for--

87
00:07:25,110 --> 00:07:27,770
Fine, then!
I'll go get it!

88
00:07:29,860 --> 00:07:32,200
- What're you saying?
- Don't! It's too dangerous!

89
00:07:34,870 --> 00:07:36,200
Maosha?

90
00:07:36,450 --> 00:07:38,660
Teach!
It's Nakim, he's--

91
00:07:41,790 --> 00:07:43,960
- Nakim!
- Don't call out to him!

92
00:07:44,380 --> 00:07:46,500
He'll be in even greater danger
if he loses his concentration.

93
00:07:46,630 --> 00:07:48,670
But why in the world is he--

94
00:07:49,590 --> 00:07:52,260
That bag is a memento
from his father.

95
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:57,220
Three years ago, Nakim came here to
this island, where his mother was born,

96
00:07:57,510 --> 00:08:00,680
...but he's never really fit in.

97
00:08:13,110 --> 00:08:14,610
Got it!

98
00:08:18,660 --> 00:08:20,290
Don't look down!

99
00:08:25,370 --> 00:08:27,080
Would you look at that!

100
00:08:30,300 --> 00:08:31,710
Teach...

101
00:08:32,130 --> 00:08:33,840
Boy, that was crazy.

102
00:08:34,090 --> 00:08:36,640
I know, but my dad
gave me this.

103
00:08:38,390 --> 00:08:42,560
I hate this island because
Dad isn't here.

104
00:08:44,600 --> 00:08:48,360
But I DO think this view
is really pretty.

105
00:08:50,150 --> 00:08:55,110
You know, I saw a view
like this once before.

106
00:08:55,400 --> 00:08:58,410
I was with a boy who
was a lot like you.

107
00:08:58,490 --> 00:09:00,370
Like me?

108
00:09:00,450 --> 00:09:04,370
I also made a whole bunch
of new friends.

109
00:09:04,830 --> 00:09:08,290
We did all kinds of things, always
working hard for a better tomorrow.

110
00:09:09,210 --> 00:09:11,170
There were also some people
who died, though.

111
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:18,760
I think you should remember
your father as best you can.

112
00:09:19,220 --> 00:09:21,890
Hold onto him tight
in your heart.

113
00:09:24,560 --> 00:09:26,810
Hey!

114
00:09:26,890 --> 00:09:30,150
Hey, Nakim!
You okay up there?

115
00:09:30,980 --> 00:09:32,820
Do you hate everyone here?

116
00:09:36,860 --> 00:09:38,110
Nakim!

117
00:09:40,030 --> 00:09:42,120
That was awesome, man!

118
00:09:42,450 --> 00:09:45,160
You climbed this huge tree
all by yourself!

119
00:09:45,330 --> 00:09:48,960
We can't just call you Nakim now!
You're Nakim the Tree-climber!

120
00:09:49,040 --> 00:09:50,540
Nakim the Tree-climber!

121
00:09:51,630 --> 00:09:52,710
Thanks.

122
00:10:05,310 --> 00:10:08,890
The Spiral Nemesis will bring about
this universe's destruction.

123
00:10:09,230 --> 00:10:13,150
We Anti-Spiral exist to
prevent that event.

124
00:10:13,520 --> 00:10:15,480
Having passed one million,

125
00:10:15,610 --> 00:10:18,070
...humans will become a power
that will be a threat to our own.

126
00:10:18,610 --> 00:10:21,110
And so, we will destroy you
before that can happen.

127
00:10:21,490 --> 00:10:24,830
That's what the Humanity Annihilation
System is? That mecha earlier?

128
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:29,460
In three weeks' time, the moon will
leave its orbit and impact the Earth.

129
00:10:29,580 --> 00:10:31,040
And that will be
the end of it.

130
00:10:31,130 --> 00:10:36,050
In response, the New Government pressed
charges against former Commander Simon.

131
00:10:36,340 --> 00:10:39,590
As a result of his trial today,
he was sentenced to death.

132
00:10:40,970 --> 00:10:42,090
Citizens will be evacuated to 36 giant
underground shelters around the world.

133
00:10:42,090 --> 00:10:44,350
Citizens will be evacuated to 36 giant
underground shelters around the world.
- Teach!
- It's all right.

134
00:10:44,470 --> 00:10:46,010
Residents in the Kamina city area,
which has no shelter,
Let's believe in the
New Government.

135
00:10:46,020 --> 00:10:47,140
Residents in the Kamina city area,
which has no shelter,

136
00:10:47,430 --> 00:10:50,810
...will temporarily leave the stratosphere
in the Superdreadnought Space Dai-Gun.
What are those
guys doing?!

137
00:10:50,810 --> 00:10:52,440
...will temporarily leave the stratosphere
in the Superdreadnought Space Dai-Gun.

138
00:10:54,360 --> 00:10:58,150
Listen, everyone! A Gun-boat will
be here in an hour to evacuate us.

139
00:10:58,280 --> 00:11:01,360
Make sure you haven't
forgotten anything.

140
00:11:01,700 --> 00:11:03,820
Miss Yomako!
It's our Maosha!

141
00:11:03,910 --> 00:11:05,780
We can't find our
Maosha anywhere!

142
00:11:06,740 --> 00:11:08,040
I'll go look for her, Teach!

143
00:11:08,250 --> 00:11:09,700
No, you stay here.

144
00:11:09,870 --> 00:11:12,170
I bet Maosha's up
in the lighthouse!

145
00:11:12,500 --> 00:11:15,880
Whenever anything bad happens,
she runs up there and cries.

146
00:11:17,510 --> 00:11:19,510
I can't go...

147
00:11:19,840 --> 00:11:21,590
I'm a big, fat liar...

148
00:11:21,880 --> 00:11:25,510
I can't go with Nakim!

149
00:11:36,820 --> 00:11:38,320
Those footsteps sound like a--

150
00:11:41,700 --> 00:11:45,160
Listen up, islanders!
Can you hear me?

151
00:11:45,240 --> 00:11:50,250
If this kid's life means anything to you,
hand over all the food on the island!

152
00:11:51,080 --> 00:11:52,290
Maosha!

153
00:11:52,370 --> 00:11:53,790
What good will this do you?

154
00:11:53,920 --> 00:11:56,500
If you don't run and hide,
the moon will fall on you!

155
00:11:57,960 --> 00:12:00,590
We're already wanted men!

156
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:02,880
We'd just get arrested
if we went to a shelter,

157
00:12:02,970 --> 00:12:07,930
...so it'd be smarter to load up our Gunmen
with supplies and hide out someplace!

158
00:12:08,850 --> 00:12:11,730
Do you care what happens
to this kid?

159
00:12:11,890 --> 00:12:14,230
You're dead meat!

160
00:12:19,780 --> 00:12:20,650
Stop it!

161
00:12:29,950 --> 00:12:31,330
They'll pay.

162
00:12:32,540 --> 00:12:36,040
<font color=#FFC9B9>Gurren Lagann</font>

163
00:12:37,540 --> 00:12:41,050
<font color=#FFC9B9>Gurren Lagann</font>

164
00:13:01,230 --> 00:13:02,440
What's the matter?

165
00:13:02,530 --> 00:13:06,320
If you don't hand over your food,
this kid is a goner!

166
00:13:09,280 --> 00:13:10,410
Maosha!

167
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:12,910
Maosha's gonna get eaten!

168
00:13:19,130 --> 00:13:20,130
What's that?

169
00:13:20,210 --> 00:13:21,920
What's going on?

170
00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:39,560
Maosha!

171
00:13:40,980 --> 00:13:43,150
- Oh, Maosha!
- Maosha!

172
00:13:43,480 --> 00:13:45,990
Miss... Yomako?

173
00:13:50,570 --> 00:13:52,160
Stay back, kids.

174
00:13:54,370 --> 00:13:57,000
I knew it! She's the same as
this picture in our textbook!

175
00:13:58,460 --> 00:14:00,630
Who the hell are you?

176
00:14:01,090 --> 00:14:02,960
I'm a teacher.

177
00:14:03,170 --> 00:14:06,170
Don't make me laugh!
Look at what you did to my bro!

178
00:14:06,420 --> 00:14:09,180
This will be on the test,
so pay close attention.

179
00:14:09,260 --> 00:14:10,970
You don't wreck buildings.

180
00:14:19,900 --> 00:14:22,150
You don't take children hostage.

181
00:14:28,240 --> 00:14:30,570
You don't threaten people
with violence.

182
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:37,250
Here endeth the lesson.

183
00:14:43,920 --> 00:14:45,130
You fail.

184
00:14:48,920 --> 00:14:53,850
I'm sorry, I was the one
who put your bag up there...

185
00:14:54,180 --> 00:14:55,890
I'm a really good
tree climber,

186
00:14:55,970 --> 00:14:59,930
...so I thought I'd blame it on Kunpa and
his friends, and if I got it for you, you'd--

187
00:15:00,060 --> 00:15:01,230
Maosha...

188
00:15:01,310 --> 00:15:04,690
I didn't know how much
the bag meant to you...

189
00:15:04,820 --> 00:15:06,900
Nakim, I'm sorry...

190
00:15:10,570 --> 00:15:12,240
Let's all run away
together, Maosha.

191
00:15:13,700 --> 00:15:15,660
Nakim...

192
00:15:21,500 --> 00:15:22,710
I have a message?

193
00:15:22,790 --> 00:15:27,550
Yoko, I'd like you to return to Kamina City
as soon as you hear this.

194
00:15:27,630 --> 00:15:30,760
Please come aboard the Arc-Gurren.
The surface is going to be destroyed.

195
00:15:30,840 --> 00:15:32,630
You are someone who
ought to survive!

196
00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:35,470
Please!
Contact me immediately!

197
00:15:35,850 --> 00:15:38,680
Please!
Contact me immediately!

198
00:15:38,850 --> 00:15:41,600
- Please! Contact me immediately!
- So, this is your "politics," huh?

199
00:15:42,020 --> 00:15:43,770
What a joke!

200
00:15:45,230 --> 00:15:47,190
- Teach!
- Miss Yomako!

201
00:15:47,270 --> 00:15:48,480
Are you leaving, Miss Yomako?

202
00:15:49,230 --> 00:15:51,530
I knew it,
you're really Yoko!

203
00:15:52,070 --> 00:15:56,950
No, I'll always be
your Miss Yomako.

204
00:15:58,410 --> 00:16:01,540
Yeah! You're Korehana Island's
Miss Yomako!

205
00:16:01,660 --> 00:16:03,410
- Teach!
- Miss Yomako!

206
00:16:04,460 --> 00:16:09,300
I'll go get it back for you. The pure
blue sky you kids love so much.

207
00:16:12,630 --> 00:16:15,430
As soon as I get back, I'll need to
hand out your report cards, won't I?

208
00:16:25,900 --> 00:16:29,270
We'll be waiting for you!
That's a promise, Teach!

209
00:16:30,070 --> 00:16:31,610
Goodbye!

210
00:16:31,690 --> 00:16:33,320
Teach!

211
00:16:58,220 --> 00:17:00,050
Crap, there's no end
to these things!

212
00:17:00,180 --> 00:17:01,600
Working hard as usual, Kittan!

213
00:17:01,770 --> 00:17:03,560
What? Yoko?
Yoko, is that you?

214
00:17:04,980 --> 00:17:06,020
Where's Simon?

215
00:17:06,100 --> 00:17:08,060
He's still in that
prison down there!

216
00:17:08,150 --> 00:17:10,690
Then I'll leave our "friends"
back there to you!

217
00:17:10,980 --> 00:17:12,280
Hey, wait a minute!

218
00:17:12,610 --> 00:17:16,490
Bitch! You show up out of nowhere
and steal the rescue for yourself?!

219
00:17:16,860 --> 00:17:19,780
Aw, crap...
There's still a few left, huh?

220
00:17:24,200 --> 00:17:25,540
You guys!

221
00:17:29,170 --> 00:17:31,460
What, you were just gonna sit quietly
and rot away in here?

222
00:17:31,750 --> 00:17:33,590
Yoko! Where have you been?

223
00:17:33,670 --> 00:17:35,720
I'll tell you all about it
some other time.

224
00:17:35,800 --> 00:17:39,430
If what Nia said is true,
we're in big trouble.

225
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:42,930
The moon is falling. The surface and
underground will both be destroyed.

226
00:17:43,020 --> 00:17:44,560
There's nowhere to run.

227
00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:47,350
Yeah, and it sounds like there's an
ambush waiting for them in space.

228
00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:48,980
Our back's against the wall.

229
00:17:49,060 --> 00:17:51,520
Maybe, but finding a way out
of these no-win situations...

230
00:17:51,610 --> 00:17:53,980
...is Team Gurren's stock
in trade, remember?

231
00:17:54,070 --> 00:17:56,070
Yeah. That's right.

232
00:17:56,200 --> 00:17:59,030
I see you still have as much
spunk as ever, woman.

233
00:17:59,360 --> 00:18:00,450
Viral?!

234
00:18:00,530 --> 00:18:02,160
Yoko, give me your gun.

235
00:18:06,620 --> 00:18:08,210
What are you up to?

236
00:18:08,580 --> 00:18:10,080
You heard the lady.

237
00:18:10,210 --> 00:18:13,630
Team Gurren is gonna save
every living thing on the surface.

238
00:18:13,710 --> 00:18:15,460
Oh? And how do you
intend to do that?

239
00:18:15,550 --> 00:18:18,010
How else?
We'll stop the moon.

240
00:18:18,130 --> 00:18:19,340
Are you serious?

241
00:18:19,720 --> 00:18:22,220
You should know better than anyone
that I'm ALWAYS serious.

242
00:18:22,930 --> 00:18:24,970
Who the hell do you
think I am?

243
00:18:25,140 --> 00:18:28,730
I know exactly who you are.
You're that big fool from Team Gurren.

244
00:18:38,570 --> 00:18:39,400
Guys?

245
00:18:39,490 --> 00:18:41,240
Your debt to society
has been paid.

246
00:18:41,950 --> 00:18:43,950
Well, well, here's a bunch
of familiar faces.

247
00:18:44,030 --> 00:18:46,370
- Hey, that's--
- What's HE doing here?!

248
00:18:46,790 --> 00:18:49,410
Right now, we need every good
Gunmen pilot we can get.

249
00:18:50,330 --> 00:18:52,250
- We gonna do it?
- Yeah.

250
00:18:52,380 --> 00:18:55,170
If we don't stop that thing,
Earth has no future.

251
00:18:55,380 --> 00:18:58,210
Oh, you know about that?
That'll save us a lot of time, then.

252
00:18:58,340 --> 00:19:02,260
Listen up, you bozos! We're gonna smash
that big-ass ceiling up there!

253
00:19:04,180 --> 00:19:06,010
YEAH!

254
00:19:09,060 --> 00:19:10,770
Boota! You're still alive?

255
00:19:10,940 --> 00:19:12,650
That means the gang's
all here.

256
00:19:14,690 --> 00:19:17,900
Boy, Boota, you're as tiny
as ever.

257
00:19:20,990 --> 00:19:24,490
It's a present from Leeron.
We've boosted its output, too.

258
00:19:25,120 --> 00:19:28,580
I'll launch the rest of 'em into space
on that rocket Gunmen.

259
00:19:29,080 --> 00:19:32,330
You're persistent, I'll give you that.
Both you and this.

260
00:19:32,790 --> 00:19:35,000
- Care to pilot it, Viral?
- What?

261
00:19:35,130 --> 00:19:37,800
You said you were supposed to
observe the fate of humanity, right?

262
00:19:37,880 --> 00:19:41,130
You'll have a front-row seat
there in Gurren's cockpit.

263
00:19:41,220 --> 00:19:43,090
Gurren Lagann, eh?

264
00:19:43,180 --> 00:19:45,510
Even after all the humiliation
I've suffered at its hands...

265
00:19:46,100 --> 00:19:48,180
My body is telling me
what it wants.

266
00:19:48,310 --> 00:19:49,640
All right, you're on.

267
00:19:49,730 --> 00:19:52,730
You better prepare yourself.
This baby packs a serious punch.

268
00:19:52,810 --> 00:19:56,150
I know that better
than anyone.

269
00:19:57,940 --> 00:20:00,900
We're in a hurry, you two.
Are you getting in or not?

270
00:20:09,700 --> 00:20:11,250
It fall apart!

271
00:20:11,370 --> 00:20:13,710
Don't sweat it!
Those Dan-Gunmen configurations...

272
00:20:13,830 --> 00:20:16,500
...seem to have been designed to
be used for atmospheric re-entry.

273
00:20:16,590 --> 00:20:19,250
- "Atmosphere"? What that?
- Can you eat it?

274
00:20:19,380 --> 00:20:22,550
Look, it just means that your
Gunmen can fight in space.

275
00:20:22,670 --> 00:20:25,510
All right!
We do that!

276
00:20:26,350 --> 00:20:28,640
We're counting on you.

277
00:20:35,940 --> 00:20:38,150
We'll get it back.

278
00:20:38,650 --> 00:20:42,610
A world where kids can live under the sun
without a care in the world.

279
00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:47,410
Damn it! We're not even
denting those things!

280
00:20:47,530 --> 00:20:50,450
Gimmy, calm down!
We have to stay focused!

281
00:20:50,870 --> 00:20:51,580
Damage?

282
00:20:51,700 --> 00:20:54,910
Severe damage to Block 357.
Now closing bulkheads.

283
00:20:55,040 --> 00:20:57,710
Grapearl Squadron strength
down to 53%.

284
00:20:58,130 --> 00:21:00,250
Damn these monsters!

285
00:21:00,380 --> 00:21:02,380
The moon's rate of descent
is increasing!

286
00:21:02,510 --> 00:21:05,510
Estimated time to impact
is now 20 hours!

287
00:21:05,590 --> 00:21:07,300
Hold out, no matter what!

288
00:21:07,430 --> 00:21:11,180
If this ship is destroyed here,
all that we've done will have been for--

289
00:21:12,140 --> 00:21:14,890
- What happened?!
- Spiral Power falling.

290
00:21:15,020 --> 00:21:17,730
Spiral lifeform readings
are rapidly weakening.

291
00:21:17,810 --> 00:21:18,850
They're what?!

292
00:21:18,940 --> 00:21:21,070
The people are worried.

293
00:21:21,480 --> 00:21:25,650
The people aboard the ship are
worried because of the attack.

294
00:21:25,780 --> 00:21:27,490
No, so are we.

295
00:21:27,610 --> 00:21:32,080
It can't be... How could a machine
be influenced by human emotions?

296
00:21:33,330 --> 00:21:35,960
No, that might be the case...

297
00:21:36,830 --> 00:21:41,460
If that's true,
is this my limit?

298
00:21:41,550 --> 00:21:43,920
Don't give up, Rossiu!

299
00:21:48,720 --> 00:21:50,850
It can't be!
Simon?!

300
00:21:51,430 --> 00:21:53,430
The instant you give up,
it's all over!

301
00:21:54,060 --> 00:21:58,850
Don't you remember? This drill is the
drill that will pierce the heavens!

302
00:21:59,310 --> 00:22:00,860
Viral, let's do the
you-know-what!

303
00:22:00,980 --> 00:22:03,570
That? Sure, that might
be entertaining.

304
00:22:05,940 --> 00:22:10,530
The Spiral Path, in which the twin paths
of man and beast wind and intersect!

305
00:22:10,990 --> 00:22:13,280
Join with yesterday's enemy
to smash fate!

306
00:22:13,450 --> 00:22:16,000
And grab hold of tomorrow's path
with our own hands!

307
00:22:16,160 --> 00:22:19,080
Destiny Combining!
Gurren Lagann!

308
00:22:20,330 --> 00:22:23,210
Who the hell do you
think I am?!

309
00:22:31,050 --> 00:22:35,060
To Be Continued...

<b>Next Time</b>

331
00:24:06,610 --> 00:24:09,280
When humanity is battered into
subjugation by absolute despair,

332
00:24:09,400 --> 00:24:11,240
...humanity finds a miracle.

333
00:24:11,570 --> 00:24:14,570
And the name of that miracle
is Arch-Gurren Lagann.

334
00:24:14,910 --> 00:24:20,580
<b>This is My Final Duty</b>

335
00:24:14,910 --> 00:24:17,620
Next time on
Gurren Lagann,

336
00:24:17,620 --> 00:24:20,580
..."This is My Final Duty."
