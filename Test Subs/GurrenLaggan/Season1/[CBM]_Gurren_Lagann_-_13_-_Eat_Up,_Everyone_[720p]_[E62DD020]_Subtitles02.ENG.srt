00:00:10,670 --> 00:00:15,510
Gurren Lagann

2
00:00:15,580 --> 00:00:18,110
<font color=#FFFF00>Kimi ha kikoeru?
</font>Can you hear it?

3
00:00:18,250 --> 00:00:26,250
<font color=#FFFF00>Boku no kono koe ga yami ni munashiku suikomareta
</font>This voice of mine was sucked emptily into darkness

4
00:00:26,600 --> 00:00:31,700
<font color=#FFFF00>Moshimo sekai ga imi wo motsu no nara
</font>If the world has meaning to it,

5
00:00:32,030 --> 00:00:36,570
<font color=#FFFF00>Konna kimochi mo muda de ha nai
</font>Then these kinds of feelings aren't futile

6
00:00:36,910 --> 00:00:42,610
<font color=#FFFF00>Akogare ni oshitsubusarete akirametetanda
</font>I was crushed by my longing and had given up

7
00:00:42,910 --> 00:00:47,870
<font color=#FFFF00>Hateshinai sora no iro mo shiranaide
</font>Without even knowing the color of the endless sky

8
00:00:48,280 --> 00:00:53,190
<font color=#FFFF00>Hashiridashita omoi ga ima demo
</font>I began to run, because my feelings, even now,

9
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:58,960
<font color=#FFFF00>Kono mune wo tashika ni tataiteru kara
</font>Are definitely beating against my heart

10
00:00:59,230 --> 00:01:04,030
<font color=#FFFF00>Kyou no boku ga sono saki ni tsudzuku
</font>The me of today will continue towards our destination

11
00:01:04,500 --> 00:01:10,060
<font color=#FFFF00>Bokura nari no asu wo kizuite yuku
</font>We'll amass our own tomorrows

12
00:01:10,410 --> 00:01:18,900
<font color=#FFFF00>Kotae ha sou itsumo koko ni aru
</font>The answer, yes, is always right here

13
00:01:32,710 --> 00:01:36,840
This is the tale of a man who continues
to fight against fate.

14
00:01:37,590 --> 00:01:41,640
Simon and the others emerge victorious
from their battle with Adiane, the Elegant.

15
00:01:42,100 --> 00:01:49,520
During the battle, Yoko learns of Nia's
trust in both her and Team Dai-Gurren.

16
00:01:50,400 --> 00:01:53,610
Any hard feelings that Yoko harbored
against Nia are now dispelled.

17
00:01:54,780 --> 00:01:59,280
Team Dai-Gurren's bonds of loyalty
have been made even stronger.

18
00:02:12,420 --> 00:02:14,460
Ah, so THIS is where you've been, Simon.

19
00:02:17,720 --> 00:02:19,630
Is something the matter?

20
00:02:24,060 --> 00:02:28,640
N-No, it's just that you've
really changed your image.

21
00:02:28,940 --> 00:02:33,400
- I knew it, I look odd.
- No, you don't! Not one bit!

22
00:02:33,690 --> 00:02:34,690
You mean it?

23
00:02:34,940 --> 00:02:36,150
I sure do!

24
00:02:36,280 --> 00:02:38,240
That's a relief...

25
00:02:43,410 --> 00:02:49,080
By the way, Simon... There's something
that I need to discuss with you.

26
00:02:49,210 --> 00:02:50,910
What is it?

27
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,380
The thing is, I...

28
00:02:56,460 --> 00:02:58,090
I want to be put to work!

29
00:02:59,670 --> 00:03:02,220
Everyone else is
toiling away at their tasks.

30
00:03:02,510 --> 00:03:05,890
I can't bear to be the
only one doing nothing!

31
00:03:06,140 --> 00:03:09,810
I want to do something!
To make myself useful!

32
00:03:12,190 --> 00:03:16,820
Well, you're a princess, Nia,
so seeing you smile is enough for--

33
00:03:16,900 --> 00:03:19,280
I'm no longer a princess.

34
00:03:19,490 --> 00:03:22,400
Oh, right. Um...

35
00:03:23,530 --> 00:03:24,950
Simon!

36
00:03:27,910 --> 00:03:31,040
What's this I hear about you
going without a meal all day?

37
00:03:31,290 --> 00:03:34,080
It's no big deal.
I grab a bite when I get hungry.

38
00:03:34,210 --> 00:03:35,170
Unacceptable!

39
00:03:35,250 --> 00:03:37,630
You're the only one
who can pilot Lagann!

40
00:03:37,710 --> 00:03:40,090
What would we do if you passed out
or something when we needed you?

41
00:03:40,170 --> 00:03:42,130
Eating properly
is part of your job!

42
00:03:42,380 --> 00:03:45,890
Eating properly...
is part of his job?

43
00:03:46,100 --> 00:03:48,850
Oh, I'm sorry.
Did I interrupt something?

44
00:03:48,970 --> 00:03:51,600
No, I have my answer now!

45
00:03:52,060 --> 00:03:53,480
Oh, you do?

46
00:03:53,560 --> 00:03:55,560
Uh, you do?

47
00:03:55,900 --> 00:03:59,320
Anyway... I'm gonna borrow
Simon for a while.

48
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:02,070
I swear, you never
grow up...

49
00:04:03,820 --> 00:04:06,910
I've found it.
I've found my job.

50
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:12,870
<font color=#000000>Episode 13:
Eat Up, Everyone</font>

51
00:04:20,090 --> 00:04:21,590
What's wrong with Rossiu?

52
00:04:21,710 --> 00:04:25,090
I can't pinpoint the cause,
but nothing seems physically wrong.

53
00:04:25,220 --> 00:04:27,300
It might be stress from overwork.

54
00:04:27,760 --> 00:04:31,680
Well, he's going out to fight in Gurren
day after day even though he's still a kid.

55
00:04:31,770 --> 00:04:33,180
It's hardly surprising
that he's collapsed.

56
00:04:33,310 --> 00:04:36,480
I don't really think that you're
in a position to talk here.

57
00:04:38,980 --> 00:04:40,980
What are you getting at?

58
00:04:41,230 --> 00:04:44,570
My point is, don't you think you've been
pushing yourself too hard lately?

59
00:04:44,820 --> 00:04:47,530
Not really. I'm just doing
what needs to be done.

60
00:04:51,490 --> 00:04:55,370
Awesome... Looks like we're gonna
get a taste of "palace food".

61
00:04:55,460 --> 00:04:58,460
Nia's so cute when she's
working hard...

62
00:04:58,540 --> 00:05:01,500
I've been fasting since yesterday
to get ready!

63
00:05:01,670 --> 00:05:04,720
That's going a little
too far, dude...

64
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:06,720
Wow, I'm impressed.

65
00:05:06,840 --> 00:05:08,550
Nia said she wanted
to work, too.

66
00:05:08,680 --> 00:05:11,470
It's nearly ready, everybody!

67
00:05:21,730 --> 00:05:24,280
- Enemy forces?
- That's what's strange.

68
00:05:24,360 --> 00:05:27,070
Judging from the size,
I'd say it's a battleship,

69
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:29,870
...but these coordinates
indicate that it's in the air.

70
00:05:29,950 --> 00:05:32,620
- The air?
- Come on, that's impossible.

71
00:05:32,700 --> 00:05:34,200
The radar is working properly.

72
00:05:34,290 --> 00:05:38,920
But if it really is an airborne enemy,
how do we go about attacking them?

73
00:05:41,250 --> 00:05:45,260
<b>Flying Carrier Fortress Gunmen:
Dai-Gunten</b>

74
00:05:43,800 --> 00:05:45,260
The time has finally come...

75
00:05:46,170 --> 00:05:48,260
...to demonstrate my power.

76
00:05:48,510 --> 00:05:53,140
<b>Cytomander, the Swift</b>

77
00:05:49,340 --> 00:05:53,140
Spiral King Lordgenome, watch closely!

78
00:05:54,890 --> 00:05:57,310
All units, advance!

79
00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:09,780
- Yoko!
- I'm taking over for Rossiu!

80
00:06:10,200 --> 00:06:11,820
I'll pilot Gurren.

81
00:06:11,950 --> 00:06:13,780
I can do it fine by myself!

82
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:18,290
You don't think I'm up to it?
I've been practicing!

83
00:06:18,710 --> 00:06:20,250
I didn't mean it like that!

84
00:06:20,380 --> 00:06:22,130
That settles it, then!

85
00:06:50,200 --> 00:06:51,490
Boota!

86
00:06:54,950 --> 00:06:55,950
Boota?

87
00:06:59,910 --> 00:07:01,960
You'll go with me, huh?

88
00:07:14,100 --> 00:07:16,760
All right, come get some!

89
00:07:16,850 --> 00:07:19,310
What's the matter?
Come down here!

90
00:07:19,390 --> 00:07:22,440
Fight me, damn it!
Fight me!

91
00:07:29,070 --> 00:07:31,450
- Second wave closing in!
- Come and get it!

92
00:07:40,830 --> 00:07:44,460
I'll remember this!
It ain't gonna happen again!

93
00:07:51,590 --> 00:07:52,760
Bastards!

94
00:07:54,050 --> 00:07:57,050
Chew on this!

95
00:08:06,190 --> 00:08:08,730
Weaklings...
Such weaklings!

96
00:08:09,480 --> 00:08:15,070
They dispatched Thymilph and Adiane
and gave even Guame a hard time,

97
00:08:15,160 --> 00:08:17,450
...so I was unsure how formidable
they would be.

98
00:08:18,910 --> 00:08:24,040
It's not that they are weak, but perhaps
rather that I am too powerful!

99
00:08:25,370 --> 00:08:27,630
Dayakka! We're going out
in Gurren Lagann!

100
00:08:27,710 --> 00:08:29,630
If you go out now,
you'll be sitting ducks!

101
00:08:29,710 --> 00:08:32,010
No! Throw us again, Leeron!

102
00:08:32,550 --> 00:08:35,430
- Are you sure about this?
- We don't have time to argue!

103
00:08:35,510 --> 00:08:37,010
Don't say I didn't warn you!

104
00:08:37,050 --> 00:08:38,260
Do it!

105
00:08:38,390 --> 00:08:39,930
Throwing!

106
00:09:01,790 --> 00:09:03,080
Damn it!

107
00:09:03,250 --> 00:09:05,040
Bastard!

108
00:09:05,870 --> 00:09:07,420
Simon, look at this!

109
00:09:08,380 --> 00:09:11,130
Hey, right!
Maybe we can integrate it!

110
00:09:24,850 --> 00:09:25,770
It worked!

111
00:09:25,850 --> 00:09:27,310
All right!

112
00:09:28,810 --> 00:09:30,480
Now we can attack
that flying battleship!

113
00:09:30,650 --> 00:09:32,020
Damn, that was cool...

114
00:09:32,150 --> 00:09:34,780
- Brother!
- Outta the way!

115
00:09:34,860 --> 00:09:36,400
Kiyoh and Kiyal?

116
00:09:37,240 --> 00:09:38,490
Hey, now!

117
00:09:41,330 --> 00:09:43,160
All right, let's pay 'em back
ten times over!

118
00:09:43,290 --> 00:09:44,910
Not so fast!

119
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:47,160
We want a piece
of this action, too!

120
00:09:47,750 --> 00:09:50,670
If this keeps up, we won't
get to eat Nia's cooking.

121
00:09:50,750 --> 00:09:52,130
- Her cooking, her cooking!
- Her cooking, her cooking!

122
00:09:52,250 --> 00:09:56,090
Okay, let's show those bastards
what Team Dai-Gurren is made of!

123
00:09:56,420 --> 00:10:00,510
Commence counterattack!

124
00:10:05,350 --> 00:10:07,520
- We'll fly right down their throats!
- Okay!

125
00:10:09,940 --> 00:10:11,650
Enemy Gunmen closing in fast!

126
00:10:11,730 --> 00:10:13,860
What? Impossible!

127
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:16,480
I didn't expect
to get to face him.

128
00:10:24,080 --> 00:10:26,700
It's been a while, naked ape!

129
00:10:27,160 --> 00:10:28,200
Is that you, Viral?

130
00:10:28,290 --> 00:10:30,290
Do you have any idea...

131
00:10:30,500 --> 00:10:33,380
...of the depths of my shame?!

132
00:10:34,250 --> 00:10:37,130
Of the humiliation of being
the sole survivor?!

133
00:10:37,260 --> 00:10:40,720
How it felt for me to beg and plead
to take part in this battle...

134
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:43,390
...so that I might have
the chance to face you?!

135
00:10:43,510 --> 00:10:46,060
Crap! I haven't got the
hang of flying yet!

136
00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:48,520
I'll clear us a path!

137
00:10:57,690 --> 00:11:00,950
Are you kidding me?!

138
00:11:01,070 --> 00:11:02,410
Yoko!

139
00:11:05,450 --> 00:11:07,120
You're not getting away!

140
00:11:08,540 --> 00:11:11,960
Viral and the enemy Gunmen have crashed
into the levi-sphere control room!

141
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:13,500
They've what?!

142
00:11:22,590 --> 00:11:24,050
Yoko?

143
00:11:26,850 --> 00:11:29,560
Why the worried look?

144
00:11:29,850 --> 00:11:32,810
Don't worry,
it's nothing serious.

145
00:11:32,980 --> 00:11:33,980
Yoko!

146
00:11:38,690 --> 00:11:40,690
What happened to Kamina?

147
00:11:45,990 --> 00:11:48,620
Why is there only a woman
and a child here?

148
00:11:49,040 --> 00:11:53,040
WHERE DID KAMINA GO?!

149
00:11:57,250 --> 00:11:58,670
My Bro is...

150
00:12:03,050 --> 00:12:07,930
If you're looking for my Bro,
he's dead.

151
00:12:09,180 --> 00:12:11,020
He's what?

152
00:12:12,560 --> 00:12:16,060
<font color=#FFC9B9>Gurren Lagann</font>

153
00:12:17,570 --> 00:12:21,070
<font color=#FFC9B9>Gurren Lagann</font>

154
00:12:31,540 --> 00:12:34,580
He... died back then?

155
00:12:35,040 --> 00:12:37,170
Kamina is dead?

156
00:12:38,500 --> 00:12:42,670
You're saying that I've been
losing to you?

157
00:12:42,760 --> 00:12:44,590
To a mere child?

158
00:12:50,560 --> 00:12:52,430
You, boy.
What is your name?

159
00:12:54,190 --> 00:12:55,690
It's Simon.

160
00:12:58,230 --> 00:13:00,150
Simon, you can't do it alone!

161
00:13:00,270 --> 00:13:02,030
I'll be fine.

162
00:13:02,360 --> 00:13:04,780
Don't worry, Yoko,
I'll protect you.

163
00:13:10,160 --> 00:13:11,870
That's a fine attitude.

164
00:13:12,370 --> 00:13:16,500
I wouldn't want you to say you lost because
you had a wounded woman on board.

165
00:13:18,040 --> 00:13:22,130
An insult done to me by a Gunmen
will be repaid in my Gunmen!

166
00:13:24,090 --> 00:13:25,880
That's the way I do things!

167
00:13:28,640 --> 00:13:32,510
No. 2 levi-sphere output falling!
Unable to maintain altitude!

168
00:13:32,600 --> 00:13:33,600
What?!

169
00:13:36,020 --> 00:13:37,310
Putting up a visual now.

170
00:13:48,070 --> 00:13:50,530
What do you think you're doing, Viral?!

171
00:13:52,370 --> 00:13:54,490
Hey, they're on fire up there!

172
00:13:54,790 --> 00:13:55,750
I see that!

173
00:13:55,830 --> 00:13:57,620
Now's our chance!
Hit 'em hard!

174
00:13:57,710 --> 00:13:59,670
We've taken a pounding, too!

175
00:13:59,750 --> 00:14:02,540
Our main guns are gone, and the engine room
is seconds away from shutting down!

176
00:14:02,630 --> 00:14:04,460
This is so frustrating!

177
00:14:04,590 --> 00:14:09,050
Simon and Yoko are in the belly of the beast!
What's the big idea, not backing 'em up?!

178
00:14:09,180 --> 00:14:12,550
I'll nail 'em with a flying kick
if that's all we got!

179
00:14:15,980 --> 00:14:17,680
I'll borrow that idea of yours.

180
00:14:28,950 --> 00:14:32,410
How can this be?! How can I be
losing to a mere human cub?!

181
00:14:32,910 --> 00:14:35,660
I'm putting an end to
this here, Viral!

182
00:14:43,840 --> 00:14:48,300
Well, I'll be. He really CAN
fight on his own...

183
00:14:57,730 --> 00:15:03,020
<b>Cytomander's Custom Gunmen:
Shuzack</b>

184
00:14:58,310 --> 00:15:00,770
You in the Gunmen, stay where you are!

185
00:15:00,770 --> 00:15:03,020
Otherwise, I'll crush this she-ape flat!

186
00:15:04,190 --> 00:15:05,730
General Cytomander!

187
00:15:06,190 --> 00:15:08,190
How long are you going
to keep fooling around, Viral?

188
00:15:08,820 --> 00:15:10,490
Forgive me, sir.

189
00:15:10,570 --> 00:15:13,950
I'm not interested in hearing
your excuses. Finish him!

190
00:15:15,700 --> 00:15:16,870
Yes, sir...

191
00:15:19,370 --> 00:15:21,370
No, don't!
Simon, keep fighting!

192
00:15:21,870 --> 00:15:23,750
Keep quiet!

193
00:15:23,960 --> 00:15:26,420
You're playing dirty, Viral!

194
00:15:26,670 --> 00:15:30,090
This happens every single time!
Is this how you do things, Viral?!

195
00:15:33,640 --> 00:15:35,510
Leeron, are you SURE
you want to do this?

196
00:15:35,640 --> 00:15:38,100
Just this once!
Hold it together!

197
00:15:38,140 --> 00:15:39,560
You can count on me!

198
00:15:46,230 --> 00:15:49,480
Dai-Gurren!
Full speed ahead!

199
00:15:58,240 --> 00:16:01,040
Damn you, what are you
playing at?

200
00:16:02,160 --> 00:16:06,670
I mustn't settle things with
the human in this manner.

201
00:16:06,920 --> 00:16:08,630
Have you lost your mind, Viral?

202
00:16:18,390 --> 00:16:23,480
I see you've forgotten your debt
to me for discovering you...

203
00:16:24,270 --> 00:16:25,850
...Viral!

204
00:16:33,320 --> 00:16:36,030
- It's a flying kick!
- Dodge it, dodge it!

205
00:16:40,660 --> 00:16:43,330
It didn't work,
we just clipped them!

206
00:16:43,410 --> 00:16:45,670
We ain't done yet!

207
00:16:55,380 --> 00:16:56,760
Viral, you bastard!

208
00:17:08,560 --> 00:17:10,060
Yoko, are you okay?

209
00:17:10,480 --> 00:17:13,990
Yeah, somehow.
Boota protected me.

210
00:17:18,280 --> 00:17:19,780
What about the guys?

211
00:17:26,120 --> 00:17:30,130
Why, that looks like a flying device!
Perfect timing! Grab it!

212
00:17:31,880 --> 00:17:33,880
Yoink!

213
00:17:35,630 --> 00:17:37,090
What the hell is going on?!

214
00:17:37,180 --> 00:17:40,430
We lost No. 1 levi-sphere!
We can't maintain level flight!

215
00:17:40,930 --> 00:17:42,560
Do whatever it takes
to keep us level!

216
00:17:42,640 --> 00:17:44,220
Y-Yes, sir!

217
00:17:45,480 --> 00:17:48,730
Viral, you will pay dearly for this.

218
00:17:50,900 --> 00:17:52,320
Yes, sir...

219
00:17:57,280 --> 00:17:59,450
- The enemy ship?
- It's retreating.

220
00:18:02,450 --> 00:18:04,620
Looks like we managed
to drive them off.

221
00:18:15,840 --> 00:18:18,470
Say, Simon, did you know?

222
00:18:19,800 --> 00:18:23,140
I kinda had a thing for Kamina.

223
00:18:27,020 --> 00:18:28,980
Yeah, I knew.

224
00:18:32,560 --> 00:18:34,730
You did, huh?

225
00:18:39,240 --> 00:18:41,320
Your bones and organs
seem okay.

226
00:18:41,410 --> 00:18:44,200
A little bed rest,
and you'll be good as new.

227
00:18:45,200 --> 00:18:48,120
It can be a pain, being this tough.

228
00:18:51,170 --> 00:18:53,170
Yoko, are you all right?

229
00:18:53,250 --> 00:18:56,840
I'm fine, I'm fine!
Leeron's overreacting, that's all.

230
00:18:56,920 --> 00:18:58,050
Don't worry.

231
00:18:58,130 --> 00:18:59,670
Thank goodness...

232
00:19:02,300 --> 00:19:06,560
If you're hungry, let's all eat
the dinner I made earlier!

233
00:19:10,310 --> 00:19:13,770
Weren't you listening?
Eating properly is part of your job!

234
00:19:13,860 --> 00:19:15,520
Go on, shoo!

235
00:19:16,610 --> 00:19:20,030
- I'll come by later.
- I'll come visit, too.

236
00:19:28,330 --> 00:19:29,950
- Rossiu?
- Rossiu?

237
00:19:37,670 --> 00:19:41,130
The thing is...
It all started yesterday.

238
00:19:41,720 --> 00:19:45,890
I was walking by, and Nia asked me
to be her taste tester.

239
00:19:53,900 --> 00:19:58,770
Its taste was not of this world.

240
00:19:59,360 --> 00:20:03,110
However, Nia looked so happy
as she was cooking...

241
00:20:03,200 --> 00:20:06,490
...that I could not bring myself
to come out and say it was awful.

242
00:20:06,620 --> 00:20:10,120
And so, I sampled every last dish...

243
00:20:11,660 --> 00:20:13,660
Ah, that's what caused it.

244
00:20:17,210 --> 00:20:18,460
- Oh, no!
- Oh, no!

245
00:20:18,550 --> 00:20:21,460
There is plenty to go around!

246
00:20:21,920 --> 00:20:26,180
Eat up, everyone!

247
00:20:40,940 --> 00:20:42,440
It's great!

248
00:20:44,200 --> 00:20:48,200
The operation's failure rests entirely
on this man's insubordination.

249
00:20:48,330 --> 00:20:49,990
In addition to being incompetent,
he is defiant, as well!

250
00:20:50,080 --> 00:20:52,910
A fool beyond any hope
of redemption!

251
00:20:53,120 --> 00:20:55,670
I ask that you sentence him
to death!

252
00:20:57,500 --> 00:20:59,380
Majesty!

253
00:20:59,630 --> 00:21:03,170
If you order me to die,
I will gladly obey.

254
00:21:03,260 --> 00:21:07,050
But before then, there is something
that I must know!

255
00:21:07,140 --> 00:21:08,800
Restrain yourself, Viral!

256
00:21:09,350 --> 00:21:11,930
Very well.
Ask your question.

257
00:21:12,020 --> 00:21:16,310
Are the humans truly creatures
that are inferior to Beastmen?

258
00:21:17,190 --> 00:21:21,940
These humans...
what the hell are they?!

259
00:21:24,860 --> 00:21:27,860
- Cytomander, leave us.
- Sire?

260
00:21:28,530 --> 00:21:31,370
I will see to this man.

261
00:21:31,450 --> 00:21:32,950
Y-Yes, sire.

262
00:21:40,500 --> 00:21:44,300
Beastmen are
imperfect creatures, indeed...

263
00:21:44,590 --> 00:21:49,890
To maintain their powerful bodies,
it is absolutely essential for them...

264
00:21:49,970 --> 00:21:54,850
...to go into a deathlike sleep,
during which time their cells rejuvenate.

265
00:21:55,140 --> 00:22:00,810
If one were to stay awake,
every cell in his body would die.

266
00:22:03,320 --> 00:22:06,820
Spiral King, it is you
who gave us Beastmen life.

267
00:22:06,900 --> 00:22:09,030
Why would you give us
such flawed bodies?

268
00:22:13,580 --> 00:22:16,200
What are humans?

269
00:22:21,130 --> 00:22:25,250
Do you really wish
to know the answer?

270
00:22:25,760 --> 00:22:28,050
Do you, Viral?

271
00:22:29,680 --> 00:22:31,050
Yes!

272

No matter how thick the wall,

With that belief in our hearts, we continue
to pound away at it together.
