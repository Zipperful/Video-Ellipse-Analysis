1
00:00:10,670 --> 00:00:15,510
Gurren Lagann

2
00:00:15,580 --> 00:00:18,110
<font color=#FFFF00>Kimi ha kikoeru?
</font>Can you hear it?

3
00:00:18,250 --> 00:00:26,250
<font color=#FFFF00>Boku no kono koe ga yami ni munashiku suikomareta
</font>This voice of mine was sucked emptily into darkness

4
00:00:26,600 --> 00:00:31,700
<font color=#FFFF00>Moshimo sekai ga imi wo motsu no nara
</font>If the world has meaning to it,

5
00:00:32,030 --> 00:00:36,570
<font color=#FFFF00>Konna kimochi mo muda de ha nai
</font>Then these kinds of feelings aren't futile

6
00:00:36,910 --> 00:00:42,610
<font color=#FFFF00>Akogare ni oshitsubusarete akirametetanda
</font>I was crushed by my longing and had given up

7
00:00:42,910 --> 00:00:47,870
<font color=#FFFF00>Hateshinai sora no iro mo shiranaide
</font>Without even knowing the color of the endless sky

8
00:00:48,280 --> 00:00:53,190
<font color=#FFFF00>Hashiridashita omoi ga ima demo
</font>I began to run, because my feelings, even now,

9
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:58,960
<font color=#FFFF00>Kono mune wo tashika ni tataiteru kara
</font>Are definitely beating against my heart

10
00:00:59,230 --> 00:01:04,030
<font color=#FFFF00>Kyou no boku ga sono saki ni tsudzuku
</font>The me of today will continue towards our destination

11
00:01:04,500 --> 00:01:10,060
<font color=#FFFF00>Bokura nari no asu wo kizuite yuku
</font>We'll amass our own tomorrows

12
00:01:10,410 --> 00:01:18,900
<font color=#FFFF00>Kotae ha sou itsumo koko ni aru
</font>The answer, yes, is always right here

13
00:01:32,630 --> 00:01:35,630
Just then, a Gunmen's
big mitts came at me!

14
00:01:35,760 --> 00:01:37,670
The mighty Kamina
was in a tight spot!

15
00:01:37,800 --> 00:01:41,930
What saved me was Lagann, under the
control of my blood brother Simon.

16
00:01:42,350 --> 00:01:44,100
"You won't lay a hand
on my brother!"

17
00:01:44,180 --> 00:01:47,640
As that shout rang out, the Gunmen's
hand was shattered by a drill!

18
00:01:47,770 --> 00:01:49,980
Thank you, my friend!
My brother!

19
00:01:50,150 --> 00:01:54,270
Lagann ripped its hatch open, and this
is what I said to the Beastman inside.

20
00:01:55,150 --> 00:01:56,190
"Hey, animal!"

21
00:01:56,320 --> 00:01:59,200
The other hero of the hour
is pretty reserved, I see.

22
00:02:02,490 --> 00:02:05,540
"Hero"?
No, I'm no hero.

23
00:02:07,370 --> 00:02:11,420
Tell me...
Is he okay?

24
00:02:11,460 --> 00:02:12,250
Bro?

25
00:02:12,290 --> 00:02:16,210
Yeah. He wanted to go to the surface
to be reunited with his father,

26
00:02:16,260 --> 00:02:18,130
...who left him when he
was young, right?

27
00:02:18,170 --> 00:02:20,550
But then he found out he'd
been dead all this time.

28
00:02:20,590 --> 00:02:23,800
He's pretending not to care, but that had
to come as a shock, don't you think?

29
00:02:24,390 --> 00:02:26,180
I think it's something else.

30
00:02:27,140 --> 00:02:29,310
He didn't want to see his father.

31
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:32,400
He hated himself for not being able
to go with him in the first place.

32
00:02:32,650 --> 00:02:37,150
He's now a man who CAN go.
That's why he wanted to see his dad.

33
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:42,490
But doesn't that still boil down to him
wanting to be reunited with his father?

34
00:02:42,620 --> 00:02:44,620
No, it's different!
Totally different!

35
00:02:45,330 --> 00:02:46,540
I think.

36
00:02:46,620 --> 00:02:48,700
I don't really follow you.

37
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:52,040
Sorry, it's not very easy
to put it into words.

38
00:02:52,170 --> 00:02:54,630
That's okay.
Thank you.

39
00:02:55,040 --> 00:02:56,960
I hope he really is okay.

40
00:02:57,050 --> 00:02:59,380
Sorry for asking such
a strange question.

41
00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:09,520
Episode 3:
Who Do You Think You Are, Having Two Faces!?

42
00:03:10,940 --> 00:03:12,560
This turned out great.

43
00:03:12,940 --> 00:03:15,360
They said they combined
all three of those Gunmen.

44
00:03:16,020 --> 00:03:18,280
What's that logo
on your back?

45
00:03:18,820 --> 00:03:22,070
Ain't it great? That's the logo
of Team Gurren!

46
00:03:24,320 --> 00:03:28,120
So anyway, I'm about to go hunting.
Would you mind keeping me company?

47
00:03:28,160 --> 00:03:32,290
Say what? What're we supposed to do
if Gunmen show up while we're out?

48
00:03:32,370 --> 00:03:36,420
I don't think any more will come today.
They only come in the morning.

49
00:03:36,880 --> 00:03:37,630
Oh, really?

50
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,760
They seem to have a set of rules
that they operate by.

51
00:03:41,050 --> 00:03:44,890
We have to find food and water
while there's no fighting.

52
00:03:45,300 --> 00:03:47,260
It's a bit of a hike,
so give me a lift.

53
00:03:47,310 --> 00:03:49,970
All right.
Simon, let's go!

54
00:03:50,310 --> 00:03:55,100
Me, too? Are you sure you
want me to tag along?

55
00:03:55,730 --> 00:03:57,650
I guess.

56
00:03:58,860 --> 00:04:03,400
So let me get this straight, all those
weapons are from your village?

57
00:04:03,570 --> 00:04:07,950
That's right. For generations, it stood
guard over a forbidden storehouse.

58
00:04:08,200 --> 00:04:11,370
But one day, poison gas started
leaking out of the storehouse,

59
00:04:11,450 --> 00:04:13,870
...and our underground village
became uninhabitable.

60
00:04:14,170 --> 00:04:19,590
Apparently, Littner Village is a weapons
cache that was built centuries ago.

61
00:04:19,840 --> 00:04:22,010
Ah, and that's why you
came to the surface.

62
00:04:22,090 --> 00:04:24,880
It was because of the weapons that
we were driven to the surface,

63
00:04:24,970 --> 00:04:27,430
...and it's those weapons
that let us fight the Gunmen.

64
00:04:28,300 --> 00:04:29,970
Ironic, isn't it?

65
00:04:31,270 --> 00:04:32,220
Got it!

66
00:04:33,770 --> 00:04:38,190
This rifle is powered by electricity, so if
I swap out bullets for these arrows...

67
00:04:43,570 --> 00:04:45,110
Wow, you're good!

68
00:04:45,150 --> 00:04:49,200
I'm the best shot in the village.
That's why I'm allowed to use it.

69
00:04:49,280 --> 00:04:51,240
What do you say?
Want to try it?

70
00:04:51,410 --> 00:04:52,580
Can I?

71
00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:02,920
Got one!

72
00:05:03,010 --> 00:05:04,010
Wow.

73
00:05:06,840 --> 00:05:09,050
Ah, there it is!

74
00:05:11,930 --> 00:05:13,270
Huh?

75
00:05:13,350 --> 00:05:15,640
There are two arrows?

76
00:05:32,870 --> 00:05:34,370
I'm impressed, human.

77
00:05:34,410 --> 00:05:36,080
Who the hell are you?

78
00:05:37,540 --> 00:05:42,130
Human Eradication Forces,
Far East Theater Commander Viral.

79
00:05:42,210 --> 00:05:45,380
Say what? "Human
Eradication Forces"?

80
00:05:45,420 --> 00:05:47,630
Here are two useful pieces
of information:

81
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:49,800
First, the Human
Eradication Forces...

82
00:05:49,890 --> 00:05:52,800
...eradicate all humans
who come to the surface.

83
00:05:52,890 --> 00:05:56,930
Second, that game is my dinner.
You will return it to me.

84
00:05:57,270 --> 00:05:59,390
It is, is it?
Gosh, I'm ever so sorry.

85
00:05:59,480 --> 00:06:01,360
I'll return it
right this minute!

86
00:06:04,280 --> 00:06:05,570
It's still alive?!

87
00:06:08,700 --> 00:06:09,950
You're not getting away!

88
00:06:11,200 --> 00:06:15,120
Who's running? Don't insult me!
Who the hell do you think I am?

89
00:06:15,660 --> 00:06:18,660
I'm Kamina of Team Gurren! Parents
use my name to get children to behave!

90
00:06:19,670 --> 00:06:21,540
And I never turn my back
on an enemy!

91
00:06:21,790 --> 00:06:24,460
That bravado will get you killed.

92
00:06:30,260 --> 00:06:33,050
You fight well, but you're just
an amateur at swordplay!

93
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:36,680
Do you honestly think you're
a match for a trained soldier?

94
00:06:37,310 --> 00:06:40,600
Dumbass! Real men
don't think, they ACT!

95
00:06:43,940 --> 00:06:45,520
What was--

96
00:06:49,110 --> 00:06:50,780
Damn, you dodged it...

97
00:06:51,110 --> 00:06:53,950
Impressive, you managed
to injure me.

98
00:06:53,990 --> 00:06:57,450
But a sneak attack is just a sneak attack.
It's only a surprise once.

99
00:06:59,210 --> 00:07:00,790
It's over!

100
00:07:01,960 --> 00:07:03,250
Bro!

101
00:07:05,210 --> 00:07:07,000
Simon! Nice save!

102
00:07:07,460 --> 00:07:09,050
I came when I heard gunfire!

103
00:07:09,130 --> 00:07:11,010
A miniature Gunmen?

104
00:07:12,970 --> 00:07:14,430
He spotted me
way up here?

105
00:07:14,850 --> 00:07:17,430
A rebel faction, eh?
Perfect timing.

106
00:07:25,230 --> 00:07:26,400
Uh-oh.

107
00:07:27,150 --> 00:07:28,440
Simon! Kamina!

108
00:07:28,610 --> 00:07:29,440
Yoko!

109
00:07:30,530 --> 00:07:32,240
You're hurt!
Are you okay?

110
00:07:32,410 --> 00:07:35,660
Yeah! The important thing is to
get to Gurren and take him on.

111
00:07:35,780 --> 00:07:37,700
That S.O.B. boarded
his own Gunmen.

112
00:07:38,080 --> 00:07:39,870
We'll take him on,
Gunmen to Gunmen!

113
00:07:42,330 --> 00:07:43,250
Bro!

114
00:07:43,830 --> 00:07:45,630
H-How did you
get there?

115
00:07:45,670 --> 00:07:47,540
Leeron calibrated it for us.

116
00:07:47,960 --> 00:07:51,050
Now we can remain in contact
with each other during a fight.

117
00:07:51,420 --> 00:07:52,510
What's the plan?

118
00:07:52,680 --> 00:07:54,630
We fight him, what else?!

119
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:59,100
But he seems a lot tougher than
what we've fought before.

120
00:07:59,220 --> 00:08:03,020
Don't let him scare you, Simon.
You've got Lagann! You've got your drill!

121
00:08:03,100 --> 00:08:04,060
Yeah, but--

122
00:08:04,150 --> 00:08:05,440
Here we go!

123
00:08:10,360 --> 00:08:14,610
I was recalled here because there were
reports of humans stealing Gunmen,

124
00:08:14,700 --> 00:08:17,120
...but it looks like I'll have this
wrapped up before dinner.

125
00:08:18,700 --> 00:08:21,830
"Gunmen"? That lame thing
isn't its name!

126
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,290
This is Gurren!

127
00:08:23,540 --> 00:08:27,920
You're one cocky bastard,
a Beastman with two faces...

128
00:08:28,040 --> 00:08:32,460
Faces? Oh, that. It's traditional for
a warrior to have a crested helmet.

129
00:08:33,470 --> 00:08:36,430
It's not the place of some lowly human
to lecture me on such matters!

130
00:08:36,470 --> 00:08:38,930
You people need to make up
your damn minds!

131
00:08:38,970 --> 00:08:41,390
What are you,
humans or animals?!

132
00:08:44,770 --> 00:08:48,980
You acquit yourself well enough in person,
but your mecha skills need improvement!

133
00:08:54,360 --> 00:08:55,280
Kamina!

134
00:08:55,320 --> 00:08:57,660
Simon, I'll cover you!
Get in there!

135
00:08:57,870 --> 00:08:58,740
Yeah!

136
00:09:06,170 --> 00:09:07,370
Get back, Yoko!

137
00:09:07,920 --> 00:09:10,540
- Simon! Let's do the you-know-what!
- Got it!

138
00:09:12,210 --> 00:09:14,010
Chew on this!
Finishing move!

139
00:09:14,090 --> 00:09:18,840
Perfect Combustion of Manly Souls!
Cannonball Attack!

140
00:09:20,470 --> 00:09:21,640
Pathetic.

141
00:09:34,110 --> 00:09:37,360
I thought I told you. A sneak
attack is a sneak attack.

142
00:09:37,450 --> 00:09:39,570
It's only
a surprise once!

143
00:09:44,200 --> 00:09:46,750
Simon! Kamina!
He's mopping the floor with you!

144
00:09:46,960 --> 00:09:49,370
It's all over!
Die!

145
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:04,260
They're gone?

146
00:10:04,470 --> 00:10:07,520
They've mastered the art
of running away, I see.

147
00:10:09,310 --> 00:10:12,860
No matter.
I'll wrap this up tomorrow.

148
00:10:32,460 --> 00:10:36,050
<font color=#FFC9B9>Gurren Lagann</font>

149
00:10:37,550 --> 00:10:41,050
<font color=#FFC9B9>Gurren Lagann</font>

150
00:10:43,680 --> 00:10:46,430
Simon, why'd you drill a tunnel?

151
00:10:47,850 --> 00:10:50,980
I was scared.
I wanted to run away.

152
00:10:53,270 --> 00:10:55,940
I don't want to do this anymore.
Let's go back to the village.

153
00:10:56,360 --> 00:11:00,150
They have tough guys like that on their side.
We can't handle this by ourselves.

154
00:11:01,700 --> 00:11:05,280
I don't want to die. And I don't
want to see you die, either.

155
00:11:05,580 --> 00:11:08,330
If this keeps up, you're gonna
end up like your dad.

156
00:11:10,330 --> 00:11:14,290
Simon! Your drill is meant
to dig towards the heavens!

157
00:11:14,540 --> 00:11:16,420
- It's not for running away!
- But...

158
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:19,670
Tomorrow's the final showdown!
I'm getting some sleep.

159
00:11:19,880 --> 00:11:21,510
You should go to bed, too.

160
00:11:28,310 --> 00:11:29,970
Let me pilot Lagann.

161
00:11:32,020 --> 00:11:34,850
I'll pilot it instead
of Simon tomorrow.

162
00:11:35,190 --> 00:11:37,360
If I don't, you'll be killed
for sure this time.

163
00:11:37,530 --> 00:11:40,570
I'll have Ron calibrate it
to let me operate it.

164
00:11:40,950 --> 00:11:44,240
When it comes to combat,
I'm more used to it than that boy.

165
00:11:44,950 --> 00:11:48,330
Simon can't handle this.
He's not the fighting type.

166
00:11:48,740 --> 00:11:50,870
Look what happened today!
He ran away!

167
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:53,460
Simon will pull through.

168
00:11:53,500 --> 00:11:57,630
Why? How can you say that?
Why do you have such faith in him?

169
00:11:59,210 --> 00:12:01,510
There's no real logic to it,
I guess.

170
00:12:01,630 --> 00:12:03,220
What is it, then?

171
00:12:03,340 --> 00:12:07,390
It's all the same. I have faith in him
because I have faith in myself.

172
00:12:07,680 --> 00:12:10,970
And because I can believe in him,
I can believe in myself.

173
00:12:11,060 --> 00:12:13,690
It's all the same as far
as I'm concerned.

174
00:12:14,730 --> 00:12:18,270
That's what it means
to be partners.

175
00:12:28,490 --> 00:12:30,160
Don't put yourself out
on our account.

176
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:33,370
If he isn't beaten here,
we'll lose our home.

177
00:12:33,870 --> 00:12:38,670
Plus, we're looking at a guy who found
some new power by doing something nuts.

178
00:12:38,710 --> 00:12:42,880
You've got guts. I'll assign you
Team Gurren member names.

179
00:12:43,260 --> 00:12:44,420
Team Gurren?

180
00:12:44,470 --> 00:12:46,680
It's a place for manly souls.

181
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:49,100
I don't really follow you,
but we'd be honored.

182
00:12:51,560 --> 00:12:55,940
This is odd... It's not starting
even with the key inserted.

183
00:12:56,690 --> 00:12:59,110
Mechanically, there's
nothing wrong with it.

184
00:13:00,070 --> 00:13:04,240
Even if everyone else should fall,
I won't take one step from this spot.

185
00:13:04,650 --> 00:13:05,530
Yoko...

186
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:08,950
Because this is the
only home we have.

187
00:13:09,490 --> 00:13:11,580
Because we have
nowhere to run!

188
00:13:14,500 --> 00:13:17,250
Well, I suppose
it's do-or-die time.

189
00:13:36,980 --> 00:13:41,190
If nothing else, I compliment you on
waiting here rather than fleeing, human.

190
00:13:41,230 --> 00:13:44,110
And I compliment you on
not running or hiding,

191
00:13:44,150 --> 00:13:46,110
...you sorta-human,
sorta-animal freak.

192
00:13:46,400 --> 00:13:47,740
Attack!

193
00:13:53,410 --> 00:13:54,830
Something itches.

194
00:14:00,670 --> 00:14:01,540
Kamina!

195
00:14:01,630 --> 00:14:06,340
You're members of Team Gurren!
I'm not gonna let this guy take you out!

196
00:14:07,590 --> 00:14:09,630
You never learn any
new tricks...

197
00:14:10,340 --> 00:14:12,640
..do you?!

198
00:14:14,140 --> 00:14:15,470
Kamina!

199
00:14:20,230 --> 00:14:21,100
No way.

200
00:14:30,910 --> 00:14:32,160
On your feet.

201
00:14:36,080 --> 00:14:37,870
Are you ready
to die?

202
00:14:47,880 --> 00:14:49,470
I knew it, it's hopeless!

203
00:14:53,010 --> 00:14:54,890
It's no use, everybody...

204
00:14:54,930 --> 00:14:57,270
Let's give up, Bro!

205
00:15:00,440 --> 00:15:01,940
Take a good look!

206
00:15:01,980 --> 00:15:05,150
He keeps getting up.
Again and again!

207
00:15:05,480 --> 00:15:07,610
Until you show up, he'll do it
as many times as it takes.

208
00:15:07,650 --> 00:15:09,150
Kamina said something
to me.

209
00:15:09,400 --> 00:15:13,820
"Don't believe in yourself. Believe in
the me that believes in you."

210
00:15:13,950 --> 00:15:15,660
How about you?!

211
00:15:16,200 --> 00:15:17,410
I...

212
00:15:21,960 --> 00:15:23,170
I...

213
00:15:28,920 --> 00:15:30,340
I...!

214
00:15:33,390 --> 00:15:36,430
Oh, getting up again,
are you?

215
00:15:36,680 --> 00:15:39,640
I can't afford to be taken
down by you, not now!

216
00:15:39,680 --> 00:15:42,350
If nothing else,
I compliment you...

217
00:15:44,440 --> 00:15:48,900
...on not knowing when
to give up!

218
00:15:50,740 --> 00:15:51,570
Kamina!

219
00:15:51,650 --> 00:15:52,950
He's no match
for him!

220
00:15:53,030 --> 00:15:54,700
Look, it's glowing!

221
00:15:54,820 --> 00:15:57,160
This time,
it really is over!

222
00:16:00,500 --> 00:16:01,660
What the--?

223
00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:12,720
What kept you, Simon?

224
00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:15,550
I'm scared. I'm so scared
I can't stand it.

225
00:16:15,680 --> 00:16:19,350
But the thought of standing by and
watching you die is even worse!

226
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:21,180
Well put, little brother!

227
00:16:21,770 --> 00:16:24,730
Time for the last resort! It's time
to break out the you-know-what!

228
00:16:24,850 --> 00:16:27,400
The what?
Sorry, I don't know what.

229
00:16:27,610 --> 00:16:31,190
Dumbass! What else
would I be talking about?!

230
00:16:31,240 --> 00:16:32,280
We're gonna combine!

231
00:16:32,400 --> 00:16:33,400
Combine?

232
00:16:33,450 --> 00:16:34,240
Combine?!

233
00:16:34,410 --> 00:16:35,320
Combine?

234
00:16:35,740 --> 00:16:36,740
Combine...

235
00:16:36,990 --> 00:16:38,120
Forget about it.

236
00:16:38,330 --> 00:16:40,830
We'll never know unless
we try, now will we?!

237
00:16:47,210 --> 00:16:49,670
See that?! Now we have
two faces, too!

238
00:16:50,050 --> 00:16:52,210
Now we're the same
as you, fuzzball!

239
00:16:54,220 --> 00:16:56,760
You're stupid through
and through, aren't you?

240
00:16:56,840 --> 00:16:59,930
It's the pilot's skill that makes all the
difference, not the number of faces!

241
00:17:00,010 --> 00:17:01,600
Now die!

242
00:17:03,270 --> 00:17:04,390
That's impossible!

243
00:17:05,600 --> 00:17:07,060
Kamina! Simon!

244
00:17:09,940 --> 00:17:11,360
Incredible!

245
00:17:11,690 --> 00:17:13,480
What the hell is going on?

246
00:17:20,780 --> 00:17:23,660
Bro, you were right!
We really combined!

247
00:17:23,910 --> 00:17:25,870
It sure looks that way.

248
00:17:29,040 --> 00:17:31,750
They combined...?
How could mere humans do that?

249
00:17:33,170 --> 00:17:35,010
How ya like us now,
General Fuzzball?

250
00:17:35,050 --> 00:17:37,010
Now we got a lid like you
and everything!

251
00:17:37,470 --> 00:17:39,050
Go to hell!

252
00:17:39,470 --> 00:17:41,720
Nope, nope, nope,
nope, nope!

253
00:17:44,810 --> 00:17:47,060
A-A cross counter!

254
00:17:47,390 --> 00:17:49,690
You best remember this, fuzzball!

255
00:17:50,480 --> 00:17:54,780
Combining is all about one fighting
spirit slamming into another!

256
00:17:59,110 --> 00:18:03,530
A combining of courage
that sets a man's soul on fire!

257
00:18:04,200 --> 00:18:05,620
Gurren Lagann!

258
00:18:05,870 --> 00:18:08,410
Who the hell do you
think I am?

259
00:18:08,500 --> 00:18:12,540
From now on, the name of this
mecha is Gurren Lagann!

260
00:18:12,840 --> 00:18:13,840
Gurren...

261
00:18:13,880 --> 00:18:15,000
...Lagann.

262
00:18:15,090 --> 00:18:16,550
Gee, how creative.

263
00:18:17,380 --> 00:18:20,300
To think I'm now forced
to resort to my swords...

264
00:18:20,390 --> 00:18:23,470
I underestimated you, human!

265
00:18:23,760 --> 00:18:26,850
I told you, the name's
Gurren Lagann!

266
00:18:32,650 --> 00:18:36,070
How did this happen? How could he
suddenly become so powerful?

267
00:18:36,110 --> 00:18:38,360
All he did was attach
that miniature Gunmen!

268
00:18:38,610 --> 00:18:39,820
How can this be?!

269
00:18:39,950 --> 00:18:42,320
You'll never understand
as long as you live!

270
00:18:42,700 --> 00:18:44,830
Why, you...

271
00:18:46,540 --> 00:18:48,660
None of those dirty tricks,
you little--

272
00:18:49,500 --> 00:18:50,670
Kamina!

273
00:18:56,710 --> 00:18:59,840
Amazing, it even withstood
an attack like that!

274
00:19:00,340 --> 00:19:01,630
It's so tough!

275
00:19:01,720 --> 00:19:06,010
I wonder if it has a special energy field
that neutralizes the enemy's attacks?

276
00:19:06,350 --> 00:19:08,890
Perhaps they really
are special.

277
00:19:09,350 --> 00:19:11,640
Where'd you go,
you son of a bitch?

278
00:19:11,770 --> 00:19:13,190
Hold up, Bro.

279
00:19:13,230 --> 00:19:14,110
What?

280
00:19:14,190 --> 00:19:17,530
You and Gurren are both in bad shape.
Chasing him would be a bad idea.

281
00:19:18,110 --> 00:19:19,320
Simon...

282
00:19:19,990 --> 00:19:24,200
It's not because I'm scared.
Well, I am, but that's not why.

283
00:19:24,620 --> 00:19:26,990
It's so we can win
tomorrow's battles.

284
00:19:28,910 --> 00:19:32,330
It's that sensible side of yours
that keeps me breathing.

285
00:19:33,380 --> 00:19:35,750
Never mind.

286
00:19:44,970 --> 00:19:47,760
Maybe you two really are
a good set of partners.

287
00:19:48,310 --> 00:19:49,850
You and Kamina.

288
00:19:51,310 --> 00:19:52,730
Well, um...

289
00:19:53,020 --> 00:19:56,110
I'm sorry, I said some terrible
things about you.

290
00:19:56,320 --> 00:19:58,270
Now I know better.

291
00:19:58,730 --> 00:20:00,030
That's okay.

292
00:20:00,990 --> 00:20:04,740
Hey, I found something
interesting in here.

293
00:20:04,990 --> 00:20:06,410
Like what?

294
00:20:06,490 --> 00:20:09,990
I found some data on a recall point
in Gurren's program files.

295
00:20:10,080 --> 00:20:11,540
Recall point?

296
00:20:11,750 --> 00:20:14,710
Gurren started out as an
enemy Gunmen, right?

297
00:20:14,750 --> 00:20:16,670
So the place it goes to
for pickup...

298
00:20:17,460 --> 00:20:19,840
...must be their headquarters?

299
00:20:27,300 --> 00:20:30,850
Sorry, Dad, but I'm
gonna move on.

300
00:20:31,310 --> 00:20:35,480
I'm gonna go see what's over
every horizon in your place.

301
00:20:40,650 --> 00:20:42,070
You're really going?

302
00:20:42,110 --> 00:20:42,940
Yeah.

303
00:20:42,990 --> 00:20:47,110
We identified their headquarters,
so it'll be a quick job to crush it!

304
00:20:48,120 --> 00:20:51,620
I'll be okay now. Even if I
get scared, I'll tough it out.

305
00:20:53,910 --> 00:20:57,750
Here's a parting gift. Sorry.
A lot of us want to go with you, but--

306
00:20:57,790 --> 00:21:00,460
Protecting your women and children
is an important job.

307
00:21:00,500 --> 00:21:04,760
But looking at you two, I feel like
we can strive for bigger things, too.

308
00:21:05,010 --> 00:21:07,510
Yeah, so--
Hey, wait a minute.

309
00:21:07,590 --> 00:21:08,970
What's with those bags?

310
00:21:09,180 --> 00:21:12,720
Oh, you don't need
a top-rate mechanic?

311
00:21:13,140 --> 00:21:15,520
Well, I hadn't--
I guess we do.

312
00:21:16,770 --> 00:21:18,270
Dayakka, are you sure?

313
00:21:18,360 --> 00:21:21,570
Ron begged us to let him go.
I had no choice.

314
00:21:21,650 --> 00:21:22,440
But he...

315
00:21:22,480 --> 00:21:25,320
Come on, I can't let something
so fascinating pass me by.

316
00:21:25,530 --> 00:21:28,860
Besides, it's possible that these
boys might make a change.

317
00:21:28,950 --> 00:21:29,990
Change what?

318
00:21:30,700 --> 00:21:32,660
Something.

319
00:21:33,500 --> 00:21:36,410
Be good boys and see to
my luggage, would you?

320
00:21:39,290 --> 00:21:41,090
See ya around!

321
00:21:45,380 --> 00:21:47,010
You can go.

322
00:21:47,800 --> 00:21:49,760
We'll look after Littner Village.

323
00:21:50,550 --> 00:21:52,850
You have your own path
to walk down.

324
00:21:52,930 --> 00:21:56,350
Still, I had no idea you were
a sucker for his type, Yoko.

325
00:21:56,890 --> 00:21:59,810
Geez, it's not like that at all!

326
00:22:00,400 --> 00:22:01,940
Thank you, Dayakka!

327
00:22:02,020 --> 00:22:03,860
Until we meet again, Yoko!

328
00:22:08,160 --> 00:22:12,910
We'll ditch you and that heavy ass of yours
if it ever slows us down, cellar chick.

329
00:22:12,990 --> 00:22:14,290
Pipe down, you.

330
00:22:14,330 --> 00:22:18,160
Want me to put lead slugs up your butt
and out your nose, Beloved Leader?

331
00:22:18,210 --> 00:22:21,670
Wait just a minute! Team Gurren
is its own worst enemy?

332
00:22:21,710 --> 00:22:23,090
Our enemy's the Beastmen!

333
00:22:23,340 --> 00:22:26,420
You got that right!
Let's get to it, you fuzzballs!

334
00:22:26,670 --> 00:22:29,220
This time, we're gonna
attack YOU!

335
00:22:31,090 --> 00:22:35,010
To Be Continued...

00:22:42,250 --> 00:22:48,480
<font color=#FFFF00>Hikari wo motomete kage ha tawainai jooku wo shaberu
</font>'Cuz they seek light, the shadows chatter out grade-school jokes

337
00:22:48,480 --> 00:22:54,460
<font color=#FFFF00>Kikitai no ha sonna koto ja nai
</font>I don't want to listen to that crap

338
00:23:00,930 --> 00:23:06,990
<font color=#FFFF00>Taiyou motomete kage ha tamashii no nuketa koe kara
</font>'Cuz they seek the sun, the shadows suddenly change from

339
00:23:06,990 --> 00:23:12,870
<font color=#FFFF00>Kyuu ni surudoi kuchou ni kawaru
</font>The soul's missing voice to a sharp tone of voice

340
00:23:13,030 --> 00:23:19,580
<font color=#FFFF00>Sono oto ga machi no naka ni kodama-shite hibikinagara
</font>While that sound echoed and bounced in the middle of town,

341
00:23:19,580 --> 00:23:25,620
<font color=#FFFF00>Kemono no you na koe de sakebitsudzuketa
</font>I kept on screaming in a beastly voice

342
00:23:25,660 --> 00:23:28,890
<font color=#FFFF00>Kidou wo kaeta tsumori ha nai
</font>No way I'm going to change my course

343
00:23:28,890 --> 00:23:32,090
<font color=#FFFF00>Zankyou ha giratsuiteru ga
</font>The reverb's dazzling, but

344
00:23:32,090 --> 00:23:35,130
<font color=#FFFF00>Kussetsu-shite hanarete iku
</font>It refracts and comes apart

345
00:23:35,130 --> 00:23:39,260
<font color=#FFFF00>Koko no sekai ha itsumo kou da
</font>The world right here is always like this

346
00:23:46,180 --> 00:23:52,700
<font color=#FFFF00>Soto no sekai ni ha hikari ha aru no ka
</font>Is there light in the world outside?

347
00:24:05,520 --> 00:24:08,520
<b>Next Time</b>

348
00:24:06,730 --> 00:24:10,320
Faces, faces, faces! Sad faces,
sulking faces, smiley faces!

349
00:24:10,440 --> 00:24:12,450
Small faces, large faces,
angry faces!

350
00:24:12,530 --> 00:24:15,110
Happy faces,
Gunmen's pale faces.

351
00:24:15,200 --> 00:24:17,370
Next time on
Gurren Lagann,

352
00:24:15,200 --> 00:24:20,540
<b>Having Lots of Faces
Doesn't Make You Great!</b>

353
00:24:17,370 --> 00:24:19,830
..."Having Lots of Faces
Doesn't Make You Great!"
